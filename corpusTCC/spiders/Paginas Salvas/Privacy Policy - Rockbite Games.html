<h4>DATA SECURITY</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure.

Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.</p>
<h4>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h4>
<p>Our Game, Site, and services are global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world.

Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.</p>

<p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Game and/or Site. We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will post the new privacy policy on this page.</p>
<p>The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.</p>
<h4>AGE LIMITS</h4>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use or access our Game and/or Site. If you are under 13, please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address, or email address. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data. If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.</p>
<h4>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.  If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at the contact information provided above.</p>
<p> <em><strong>No fee usually required</strong></em></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><em><strong> What we may need from you</strong></em></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong><em> Time limit to respond</em></strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.  If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please let us know.</p>
<p><em><strong> Your legal rights</strong></em></p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Opt-out</strong> of marketing emails and other direct marketing.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<br />
&#8211; <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:<br />
    &#8211; If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.<br />
    &#8211; Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.<br />
    &#8211; Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.<br />
    &#8211; You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br />
&#8211;<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<br />
&#8211;<strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. You can withdraw your consent, for example, by turning off GPS location sharing in your Device settings.</p>

Personal information does not include: publicly available information from government records; deidentified or aggregated consumer information; information excluded from the CCPA’s scope, like health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data, or personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994.</p>

<p><strong>Categories of Personal Information</strong><br />

<p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>

<p><strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong></p>
<p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p><em> Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will disclose to you:</p>
<p>&#8211; The categories of personal information we collected about you.<br />
&#8211; The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.<br />
&#8211; Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.<br />
&#8211; The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.<br />
&#8211; The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).<br />
&#8211; If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:<br />
&#8211; sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and<br />
&#8211; disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</p>
<p><em><strong>Deletion Request Rights</strong></em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
<p>1. Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of your use of our services, or otherwise perform our contract with you.<br />
2. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.<br />
3. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.<br />
4. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.<br />
5. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).<br />
6. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.<br />
7. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.<br />
8. Comply with a legal obligation.<br />
9. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</p>
<p><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em></p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
<p>&#8211; Emailing us at legal@com<br />
&#8211; Through your password-protected account with us</p>
<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. To designate an authorized agent, please provide us with written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<p>&#8211; Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include you name, address, email address, and other identifiers.<br />
&#8211; Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  However, we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
<p><em> Response Timing and Format</em></p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.  If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p><em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</em></p>
<p>You have the right to opt out of our sale(s) of your personal information. Please be advised that we do not currently sell personal information. This opt-out, however, would apply to the extent we began to engage in sales of personal information governed by the CCPA.</p>
<p><u>Non-Discrimination</u></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<p>&#8211; Deny you goods or services.<br />
&#8211; Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.<br />
&#8211; Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.<br />
&#8211; Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
