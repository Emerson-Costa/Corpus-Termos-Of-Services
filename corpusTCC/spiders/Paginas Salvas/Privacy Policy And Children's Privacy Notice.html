However, some of our Services are intended as appropriate for all ages, or in other words a mixed audience of Children and other users (“Mixed Audience”). We refer to “Child” or “Children” as users under the age of consent in the EU Member State in which the child resides, or if in the U.S. or Canada, under thirteen (13) years of age. For these Services, we screen for user age and provide a modified version of the Service for those identified as Children.</p>

		<p>Where consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information is required by applicable law, such consent may be given in various ways. Consent can be express or implied (for example, when you provide Personal Information necessary for a service you have requested or the purpose is obvious). You may be asked to provide your specific consent in some special and specific circumstances where notice has been provided to you about our intentions with respect to your Personal Information and you have not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using an “opt out” option provided, if any.</p>

                            <li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Service’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.<br/><br/></li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.<br/><br/></li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Browser Fingerprinting.</strong> We may collect and analyze  information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification where permitted.<br/><br/></li>
                            
                            <li><strong>ETag, or Entity Tag</strong>. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of UID. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.<br/><br/></li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Recognition Technologies.</strong> Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).<br/><br/></li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Location-identifying Technologies.</strong> Additionally, and with your consent where required by applicable law, the Services may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies to locate you so we may verify your location, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as allow you to share your location to other users as part of the services we provide via the Services. Upon downloading the App, we provide location-based services to your approximate and/or exact location information. You can opt-out of sharing location data on most Services by adjusting your settings in your device or App. <br/><br/></li>
                            <li>In addition to traditional GPS location-based services., some of the retailers and others we work with may install low power Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the App can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the App (“<strong>iBeacons</strong>”). Because iBeacons are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Services such as to send you more specific and relevant messages and offers.  In addition, you may be able to send your location information via the Services to other Services users. You should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to other people. Where a user of the Services requests that their location information be revealed to other persons, the user will be provided options for managing sharing services, which may be through third party services such as through Twitter and Facebook. We are not responsible for the acts, omissions or policies of such third parties.<br/><br/></li>
                            
                            <li>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.<br/><br/></li>

				<li id="section1c"><strong>Information Third Parties Provide About You. </strong>We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service. Additionally, we may, from time to time, with your consent or as permitted by applicable law, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent this information is Personal Information or we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.<br/>

                  <li id="section1d"><strong>Third-Party Content and Services </strong>The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site, platform, tool, application or other service, and accessing or display of third-party content via the Service. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Service, the third-party service may send Personal Information about you to us (such as ad ID and device identifier). In addition, we may provide third-party services’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets, “likes,” content submissions or postings of comments on Facebook or other social media platforms. We may also enable access to or display of third party content via the Service, that is actually being served or published by the third party, and such third party may be collecting data from you in connection with that content. These third parties may collect and retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. Ludia may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party services in connection with our Service.<br/>

                  You may send someone else a communication from the Service, such as sending an invitation to a friend. If so, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication on your behalf and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Service, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s), except when sent by identified Children on Mixed Audience Services, in which case the Child’s full name and e-mail will not be disclosed to the recipient. If you send a message to a friend, you are responsible for ensuring that you have either obtained the express consent of this friend to do so or that you have a family relationship or a personal relationship with this friend. A “family relationship" means that you are related to this individual through a marriage, common-law partnership or a legal parent-child relationship and have had had direct, voluntary, two-way communication with this individual. A “personal relationship” means that you have had direct, voluntary, two-way communications with this individual and it would be reasonable to conclude that you have a personal relationship with this individual, taking into consideration factors such as the sharing of interests, experiences, opinions and information evidenced in the communications, the frequency of communication, the length of time since you communicated or whether you have met in person.

                        <p>This Section supplements the description of our information collection and sharing practices elsewhere in this Privacy Policy to provide, for California residents, a list of those categories of Personal Information as set forth in the CCPA that have been collected and disclosed for business purposes.</p>
                        <p>This information collected during the preceding 12 months includes: (1) identifiers, such as IP address and online identifiers, and, if you provide it to us, your name; (2) commercial information, such as a record of your purchases and services you have obtained; (3) Internet and electronic network activity information, such as information about your interactions with the Sites; (4) precise geolocation data; (5) other electronic information; (6) for job applicants, professional and employment-related information; (7) for job applicants, education information; and (8) inferences about you, including about your preferences and characteristics to, for example, tailor the Services for you and provide you more relevant offers and advertising. Some of this information also is considered personal information under Cal. Civ. Code Section 1798.80. In addition, we may collect other Personal Information outside of these categories as described in <a href="#section1">Section 1</a> of the Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>As set forth in the Privacy Policy, Ludia discloses Personal Information to service providers, to protect against fraud and malicious activity, in connection with advertising services, and for other business purposes.  During the preceding 12 months, Ludia has disclosed each of the above-listed categories of Personal Information for such business purposes. In addition, your information may be accessible to third parties with whom you interact or direct us to share your information through our services and as otherwise permitted under the CCPA.</p>
                        <p>In the preceding 12 months, Ludia has not sold personal information, as that term is defined in the CCPA.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the circumstances, California residents may have certain rights to access and delete their personal information and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.

            <p>The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third-party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your UID when such content is served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking your across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. For example, if you “click” on a link, the “click” may take you off the Service onto a different site. These third-party services may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, serve you their own ads, have practices that differ from ours and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.</p>
            
            <p>Third-party applications may also be available via the Service. The owners of these applications (“<strong>Third-Party Owners</strong>”) may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices differing from ours; however, we restrict access for identified Children on Mixed Audience Services. We are not responsible for how Third-Party Owners or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These Third-Party Owners may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of Third-Party Owners. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications.</p>
				
                <p>We also encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.</p>

          	<li id="section6"><strong>ARE INTEREST-BASED ADS SERVED ON THE SERVICE OR RETARGETED TO YOU LATER?</strong><br/><br/>
                	<p>The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges that use their own tracking technologies on the Services (including cookies and pixel tags) to serve you ads, including interest-based ads, on the Service or to serve you ads, including interest-based ads, on third-party services, websites and apps after you leave our Service, and we may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. “<strong>Interest-based ads</strong>” are behavioral ads targeted to you based on your activities on our Site and App and across third-party sites and apps and across time (such as web pages you visit and your response to ads), including retargeting of ads after you have left our Service and are on a third-party service. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Service and other apps and sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. You can avoid receiving ads in connection with our Services by not using the Services and by uninstalling our Apps. You may use the standard uninstall process as may be available as part of your applicable Device or potentially via the appropriate application or app marketplace. In addition, some third parties that serve Interest-based ads via mobile apps may offer your choices regarding such practices and their Tracking Technologies. Some may offer a Device-based opt-out option via a downloadable app available at: <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>. We are not responsible for this app, including without limitation its accuracy or limitations, or any representations made in connection with it.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, on Mixed Audience Services we will either not serve Interest-based ads at all, or take measures to restrict them to non-Children, though we may serve other ads as permitted by COPPA (e.g., run of service ads, contextual ads, etc.) or other applicable law. Further information on our policies for Children is found in <a href="#section11">Section 11</a> below.</p>
					
                    <p>The Service’s third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a UID. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Further information on third-party tracking and Do Not Track is found in <a href="#section1b">Section 1(b)</a> above.</p>
                    <p>Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are associated with our Service or our ads. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. The relevant third-party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing or disclosure practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>
                    <p>Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.

                	<p>Many of our Services are not directed to Children (i.e., under the age of consent in the EU which ranges between 13 and 16 years of age depending on the Member State, of if in the U.S. or Canada under thirteen (13) years of age). Other of our Services are what we refer to as Mixed Audience Services, and are intended for both Children and older users. We do not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) (“Children’s Personal Information”), the GDPR or other applicable privacy law in a manner that is not permitted by applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have, please contact us <a href="mailto:privacy@ludia.com">privacy@ludia.com</a> and we will remove such data to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
                    <p>For these Mixed Audience Services, we screen for user age and provide a different version of the Service for those identified as under the age of consent in the EU, or if in the U.S. or Canada thirteen (13) years of age, that does not collect Children’s Personal Information except as permitted by applicable law. For example, we disable certain features (such as push notifications and certain tracking technologies) and allow players to log in using a guest profile and generic player name. We may still collect and use IP address and device ID for authentication, fraud prevention, customer support and game optimization purposes.  Without limitation, we will either not serve Interest-based ads (ads based on user profiles built by tracking user activities across sites or on the services) on Mixed Audience Services, or do so in a manner that limits Interest-based ads to users identified as non-Children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your Child has misidentified his or her age on a Mixed Audience Services, or that we have otherwise collected and/or are using Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by applicable law, please contact us <a href="mailto:privacy@ludia.com">privacy@ludia.com</a> and we will discontinue that account, or convert it to a Children’s version, and remove associated Children’s Personal Information to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
                    <p>We may also offer subsections of our general audience Services that are identified as for Children (e.g., “KIDS GAMES”), and on such special subsections of our Service we will limit our data collection and use activities to comply with the obligations of COPPA for Child-directed services and other applicable privacy laws.</p>
