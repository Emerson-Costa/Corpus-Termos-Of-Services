                            <br/>

                            We have redesigned this Privacy Policy to help you understand what data we and

                            <h3><b>2. Information we collect and use</b></h3>

                            When you interact with our Apps, our trusted partners may collect information
                            about your device. The process of collecting data is designed so that it avoids
                            collection of information that identifies you personally, such as your name,
                            address, email address or similar; instead, the information collected does
                            enable us and our partners to recognize your device over time for purposes of
                            improving the quality of our products and your experience with them.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            As a general rule, we do not collect or share any information that may be used
                            to identify you as a person except when you contact us by email. In that case we
                            will save your emails in order to serve you better. Once we are finished
                            providing support to you we will delete all emails received by and sent to you.
                            Please note that we take all the necessary steps to safeguard any personal
                            information you may provide by email using strong passwords and 2-step
                            authentication.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            Information that is collected by our partners may be divided into the following
                            categories.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            <h4><b>A. Information for showing personalized ads</b></h4>

                            Note: This section (collection of data to personalize ads) applies only to any

                            of any of our apps or you have paid to remove ads, this section does not apply.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            In order to be able to provide our Apps to you for free we display ads.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            We work with third-party Marketing/Ad tech partners who may have their SDK/API
                            integrated with this application. Such partners may obtain and lawfully use device
                            identifiers, IP address and location data to improve user targeting by data analysis which
                            is important for interest-based ads and marketing solutions relevant to the user. This
                            information may be shared with their clients for the permitted purposes stated above
                            (whether within or outside of the country of origin). All such collection permitted
                            processing and transfer will be in accordance with applicable data privacy laws.

                            <br/>

                            <h4><b>B. Information for analyzing application performance issues and crashes</b></h4>

                            In order to improve our Apps, we use third party services (our analytics
                            partners) to collect and analyze error and performance issues. The information
                            collected in the case of an error is divided into two categories.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                                <li>Device/hardware information which includes information such as device model,
                                    screen information, total memory, internal and external storage, device language,
                                    and Android version
                                </li>
                                <li>Error or performance related information, which includes error description,
                                    time that the error occurred, stack trace (a detailed error report), free
                                    memory and free disk space at the time of the error, etc.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <br>

                            This data helps us analyze and correct performance issues and errors
                            and improve your experience with our Apps.

                            your experience with our Apps by improving existing functionality and adding new
                            functionality.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            The information that we collect in this case includes information that is
                            collected in section B above as well as usage statistics. Usage statistics
                            include information on how often a user opens a specific page inside the app,
                            icons and themes used, widgets used, etc.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            Note that none of this information collected in Sections A, B and C can be used
                            to identify you as an individual.

                            On Android devices you can turn on/off the location service API from device
                            settings, Location (note that the path may be different on different devices).

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            To prevent ad partners from using your device's ad identifier being used for
                            interest-based advertising you can change the relevant settings on your device.
                            Please see <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">optout.networkadvertising.org</a>

                            If you live in the USA, Europe or Canada, you can also opt-out from the
                            collection of your information by some or all of our advertising partners who
