<li>Personal device settings (device aliases)</li>
<li>Device runtime statistics (battery level, connectivity status)</li>
<li>IP addresses where you use our products and services</li>
<li>Linkage between accounts under the service</li>

<li>Questions, replies, comments and other data posted on our forum, social media platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Our products and services are designed to provide you with the ability to see, hear, and speak to anyone on your monitoring device. In order for our products and services to function properly, we obtain content and related information that is captured and recorded when you use our products and services. For example, we store the events captured by the motion detector in our servers in order to provide evidence to identify the suspect. In addition, our products and services may also collect data from their surrounding environment to perform certain functions (such as Motion Detection and Auto Low-Light Filter that is activated automatically when it’s unlit).</p>
<h4><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></h4>
<p>We may use cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other information gathering technologies to obtain certain information that helps us identify you quickly. These types of information include IP address, identifiers associated with your devices, types of devices connected to our services, web browser characteristics, device characteristics, language preferences, referring/exit pages, clickstream data, and dates and times of website or app visits.</p>
<p>These technologies help us (1) identify you and count visits to our websites; (2) keep track on how you interact with our products and services; (3) customize the services based on your preferences; (4) understand usage of our products and effectiveness of our communications; and (5) manage and improve our products and services.</p>
<p>For free users, our advertising partners may collect information by automatic means through our app to display and manage advertising on our app. For example, your usage patterns on our app may serve as an important reference for them to suggest interest-based advertisements to you. Please rest assured that this type of information is processed in a non-identifiable way and that they also have strict rules for processing such information. Please check&nbsp;<a href="#h_8ae1cdf2-c57d-487e-851d-99e378bd958a" target="_self">here</a>&nbsp;to learn more about the service providers’ policies. If you are not willing to have such information used for the purpose of presenting you interest-based ads, you may opt-out from the instructions in <a href="/hc/articles/900001977286-Alfred-Opt-Out-Information?utm_source=zendesk&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=privacy%26security_PP_opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>How And Why We Use The Information</strong></h3>
<p>We collect information stated above to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide, develop and improve our products and services for you. For example, we store your data in our servers in order to allow you to stream videos, save content and share it with others with your permission</li>
<li>Pursue legitimate interests, including conducting research, helping us form business decisions, personalizing the services for you based on the types of devices you are using or the environment where you have your devices set up</li>
<li>Comply with legal obligations. For example, we may process your information in response to legal process or law enforcement requests</li>
<li>Communicate with you, such as providing potentially practical tips and special offers for you</li>
<li>Address technical issues reported by you to improve functionalities and availabilities of the services</li>
<li>Investigate potential violations of Terms of Service</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, the data we use for research and analyzing purposes are processed in a non-identifiable form, which means the information is processed anonymously and will never be associated with you.

We may also use machine learning algorithm to access the data automatically without manual operation and help us provide personalized services for specific groups of individuals. We use such information to help us increase sales, make marketing decisions and pursue legitimate interests.</p>
<p>However, we may access your information in a personally identifiable way under the following circumstances: (1) when you encounter any technical issue and request that we address such issue; (2) when we investigate potential violations of Terms of Service; (3) when we have to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request. Whenever your personal information is involved in any case stated above, we will always ask for your consent before taking any further action. Please also note that this principle is established for those who are in compliance with our Terms of Service.</p>
