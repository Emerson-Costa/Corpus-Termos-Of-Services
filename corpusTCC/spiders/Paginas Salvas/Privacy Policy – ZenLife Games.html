Studio may need to ask you to provide certain information to make sure you are who you claim to be. If you find the information on your account is not accurate, complete or updated, then please provide Studio with the necessary information to correct it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Withdrawing Your Consent. Contact us if you would like to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data. Exercising this right will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erasing or Restricting Access to Your Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request to delete or restrict access to your personal data. We may postpone or deny your request if your personal data is in current use for providing Services or for other legitimate purposes, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transferring your Personal Data (Otherwise known as Your Right to Data Portability).&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to transmit that data to another party of your choice, where technically feasible.

<p>Right to Make Complaint: if you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have any concerns about the way we process your personal data, you are welcome to contact our data protection officer at&nbsp;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0f7f7d66796e6c764f756a616366696a686e626a7c216c6062"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b9c9cbd0cfd8dac0f9c3dcd7d5d0dfdcded8d4dcca97dad6d4">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>&nbsp;or write to us at the address set forth in the “Contact Studio” section.

<h4>6. Security Safeguards.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Studio takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Services in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage on our systems.&nbsp; Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to this information.&nbsp; We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>



<h4>7. <strong>Data Retention</strong>.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Studio retains your personal data for as long as needed to provide you Services, unless we are required by law to delete or if Studio accepts your request to delete the information.

<h4>10. Lawful Basis for Processing.&nbsp;</h4>

<p>On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law.&nbsp; We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.</p>



<p>Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers; where&nbsp;these interests&nbsp;are not overridden by your data protection rights.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>11. Specific Provisions for California Consumers</h4>



<p>These additional provisions for California consumers apply only to individuals who reside in California.&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and requires “businesses” collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notice and a means to exercise those rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Categories of personal information collected in the preceding 12 months:</p>



<ul><li>Section 2 of this Policy</li></ul>



<p>Business purpose for collection</p>



<ul><li>Section 3 of this Policy</li></ul>



<p>Third parties with whom we may share your information</p>



<ul><li>Section 4 of this Policy</li></ul>



<p>Right to Know and Right to Delete</p>



<p>For any of the personal information described above, you can request to know what personal information we collected, disclosed, used and sold, and request that we delete your personal information at any time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To exercise your right to know and right to deletion, please submit a request by:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emailing&nbsp;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3545475c4354564c754f505b595c535052545850461b565a58"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="49393b203f282a3009332c2725202f2c2e28242c3a672a2624">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>&nbsp;with the subject line “California Rights Request.”&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to verify your identity before processing your request. In order to verify your identity, we will generally require the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the right to know and right to deletion, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity.</p>



<p>Upon verification of your request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to complete the transaction with you, detect security incidents or fraud, fixing errors, exercise free speech or another right provided by law, comply with legal obligations, or other internal and lawful uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right to Opt Out of Sale</p>



<p>CCPA gives you a right to direct a business that sells your personal information to stop selling&nbsp;&nbsp;your personal information and to refrain from doing so in the future. We do not sell any of your personal information and will require our service providers not to sell your personal information.</p>



<p>You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights listed above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a California resident seeking to exercise your rights under the CCPA or have any questions or concerns, please email us at&nbsp;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1161637867707268516b747f7d78777476707c74623f727e7c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="88f8fae1fee9ebf1c8f2ede6e4e1eeedefe9e5edfba6ebe7e5">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf where (i) you provide sufficient evidence to show that the requestor is an authorized agent with written permission to act on your behalf and (ii) you successfully verify your own identity with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We aim to respond to a consumer request for access or deletion within 45 days of receiving that request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>



<h4>12. Changes to This Policy.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&nbsp;We may update this Policy to reflect changes to our data and information privacy practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective.
