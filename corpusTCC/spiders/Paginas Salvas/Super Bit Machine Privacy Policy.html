When you use the Service you provide us with three types of information: (i) information you submit via the Service; (ii) information regarding your use of the Service collected by us as you interact with the Service; and (iii) information from Third Party Websites and services. The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Service and to provide you with the services and information you request. In connection with certain aspects of the Service, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personally Identifiable Information. We collect several types of information from and about you, including:<br>
<br>
• information that, taken alone, identifies you and that can be used to contact you, on-line or offline (“Personally Identifiable Information”), which may include, for example, your legal name, legal physical address, email address, phone number, date of birth, and gender;</p>

<p>• information about you that cannot be used, alone, to identify you, which may include, for example, demographic information including zip code or professional information including the industry in which you work; and</p>

<p>• information about your use of our Service, which may include, for example, internet connection, your computer or mobile device and operating system, browser type and other software you use to access our Service, as well as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device properties, such as unique device identifier (“UDID”) or other device identifiers, mobile phone carrier, game achievements.<br>
Below, we detail the specific types of information we collect from our users.<br>
<br>
Account Information<br>
When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personally Identifiable Information. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Service and providing Personally Identifiable Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you, and therefore, you may not be anonymous.<br>
We may use your contact information to send you information about our Service or to send marketing emails. When applicable, our marketing emails tell you how to “opt-out.” If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your Account and our business dealings with you. We also reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for Account recovery purposes.<br>
<br>
IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically<br>
We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Service, including your IP address and cookie information. Generally, the Service automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Service. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Service so that we can analyze and improve them.<br>
<br>
Information Collected Using Cookies and Web Beacons<br>
“Cookies” are small data files that are sent to your web browser when you access a website, and the files stored on your device’s hard drive. We use “session” cookies to keep you logged in while you use our Service, to track your preferences and to track trends and monitor usage and web traffic information on our Service. These are erased when you close your browser. We use “persistent” cookies to relate your use of our Service to other information about you and store information about your preferences to make your user experience consistent and customized. For example, we may create a persistent cookie that includes some basic information about you, like your favorite website locations and whether customer support responded to your inquiry. These cookies stay on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire and associate your information with your account even if you are logged out.<br>
<br>
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your settings on the browser settings to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting cookies. You can also use your browser settings or other tools to delete cookies you already have. However, if you disable or refuse cookies, then certain features of our Service may be inaccessible or not function properly.<br>
<br>
Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personally Identifiable Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personally Identifiable Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Service and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.<br>
This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.<br>
Clear GIFs and Pixel Tags<br>
<br>
We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on our Service or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a part of our Service or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a website or in an email or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote website on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a website or message.<br>
<br>
We do not automatically collect Personally Identifiable Information, but we may tie Personally Identifiable Information with the automatically collected information using the above tools or information collected from other sources.<br>
<br>
We may also log information using digital images called web beacons on our Service or in our emails. We may use web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. We may also use web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.<br>
<br>
The Service does not respond to Internet browser’s Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.<br>
We may also use services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics, a web analytics services provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to assist in providing the Service. Google Analytics use cookies to help us analyze how users use the Service. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Service (including your IP address) will be transmitted to, and stored by, Google on their servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Service. By using these Service, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.<br>
<br>

To support and enhance the Service, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Service. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.<br>
<br>
Advertisements served through the Service may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on (i) anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personally Identifiable Information, (ii) Service usage patterns of particular users, or (iii) your activity on a third party website.
