        <h2 class="h2">ATTENTION:</h2>
        <p>
            The simple access to the game results in the assumption that you have read the most recent and updated version of the Terms of Use. In addition, we will assume that you have agreed to all of the conditions set out here. For this reason, we recommend that you read this document carefully BEFORE downloading the game application. We also recommend reading all the other policies we have adopted, such as our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth in the Terms of Use or if you do not agree to any of our policies, we suggest you not to access or use the game. But of course, if you just have any question about the usage rules, feel free to contact us via the email <a href="mailto:suporte@cifraclub.com.br">suporte@cifraclub.com.br</a>. We will be glad to answer you!

            <strong>1. Free download / In-app Purchases</strong>
            Until now, the game has a free download. The only case in which any payment will be made by the users will be when they choose to buy any item from the Store in the game, such as Supplements, Guitar Cases, Packs, Coins and other items that may be created within the game. Payment for items purchased from The Lost Guitar Pick store is strictly made via Google Play Games (for Android devices) or Game Center (for iOS devices). Because of that we, the game's developers, do not request and much less store any of the gamer’s financial information (such as the bank card number, for example).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Registry</strong>
            Logging in via Google Play Games (for Android devices) or Game Center (for iOS devices) is only meant to save the user's progress in the game, recapping the achievements he has had over the finished levels so he does not have to repeat them. We remind you that this backup of the game progress is made using Google Play Games or Game Center, where each user has a profile linked directly to The Lost Guitar Pick.<br />
            When registering via Google Play Games or Game Center, it is essential that you have filled in all the fields indicated as mandatory and that you only enter correct, accurate and true information on the form.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Ability to register</strong>
            The application and features we own are only available to people who have full legal capacity to hire them, under Brazilian law. They can not be used, therefore, by people who do not have this capacity, who must be assisted or legally represented if they wish to play The Lost Guitar Pick. The same goes for people who have been disabled by us, temporarily or permanently, due to the inappropriate use of the sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>4. Username and password</strong>
            All user login flow is done using Google Play Games or Game Center, where each player has a profile linked directly to The Lost Guitar Pick. But be careful: the login and password must be kept by you in safety, since you will be fully responsible for the consequences of its use. For this reason, we do not recommend that you tell any such data to others. If you know of any unauthorized use of your login, we ask you to notify us immediately by e-mail (<a href="mailto:suporte@cifraclub.com.br">suporte@cifraclub.com.br</a>), otherwise you will be held responsible for the consequences of such misuse.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>5. Data Protection</strong>
            All saved data refers to your in-game progress: completed levels, collected guitar picks, and acquired coins and instructors, among other data regarding the progress in the game. The data is saved locally until the user logs in. After that, data will be saved using the free data storage service presented by each platform: Google Play Games Services for Android devices, and Game Center for iOS devices. We commit to not use the registration information provided by you to perform illegal activities, but only to backup your progress in the game, which is expressly permitted by the Brazilian law and / or these Terms of Use. In any case, the hypothesis of mandatory record keeping provided for in the Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet (Law No 12.965) or the aggregated and non-identifiable data for statistical purposes are excluded.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6. Offline progress</strong>
            The game keeps your progress saved locally on the device you are using. When you sign in to Google Play Games or Game Center, your progress is synchronized and saved online.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7. User’s Obligations</strong>
            By using our game you agree not to: <b>(a)</b> violate copyright or third-party personality rights; <b>(b)</b> use any prospecting methods or similar methods of data extraction;
            <b>(c)</b> manipulate or otherwise display the app or content using "framing" or similar navigation technology; <b>(d)</b> to register, subscribe, cancel the subscription, or to attempt to register, subscribe or cancel the subscription of any party for any product or service by those who are not expressly authorized to do so; <b>(e)</b> transmit, disseminate illegal or prohibited material, or harass,  insult, libel or defame any person or company; <b>(f)</b> disseminate information about illegal activities and incitement to crime; <b>(g)</b> make available content that has any discriminatory nature, such as ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or any other; <b>(h)</b> create false identity or use subterfuge for the purpose of deceiving others or gaining benefits; (i) transmit files that are technically harmful (including, without limitation, computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan horses, worm viruses, SQL injection, harmful components, corrupted data, or any other malicious software); and <b>(j)</b> use the game for purposes other than those for which it was created.

            <strong>10. Changes in the Terms of Use</strong>
            The Terms of Use may be modified and updated by us freely, at any time, with the purpose of adapting them to legislative updates or even to insert new commercial practices, and the changes will be effective immediately if there is no noted effective date indicated in the new version of the Terms of Use. It is important, therefore, that you always read this document before using the application. It may contain some change that you do not agree with. After all, your continued use of the game after the publication of the changes will constitute your full tacit acceptance of such changes.
