Such third parties are authorized to use your information for these purposes only.</p>

<h2>8 &ndash; Children</h2>

<p>We encourage parents and guardians to teach their children about privacy and how their information may be used on the Internet. Children should never disclose their name, address or phone number, or any personal information, without their parents&rsquo; or guardian&#39;s prior permission.</p>

<p>We consider a user to be a child if they are under the age of 13, unless more stringent regulation applies in their state of residence.</p>

<p>If we consider that any of our Services are directed at users under the minimum legal age required in their country of residence, we can block such users from using the Services or from providing information and/or limit the collection of information from such users as described below in more detail.</p>

<p>No personal information should be submitted to Gameloft by users under the minimum legal age required in their state of residence. We apply the following limitations to personal information collection for a user that is not of the minimum legal age required in their state of residence.</p>

<p>Such a user cannot:</p>

<ul>
	<li>display their real name or any information in the games</li>
	<li>access the chat, leaderboard, forums, SNS (Facebook, Game Center, etc.)</li>
	<li>subscribe to newsletters</li>
	<li>use any other feature where users could appear under their real names</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to such a user, we will prevent the collection and use of their precise geolocation data and display to them contextual advertising only (excluding any behavioral advertising).</p>

<p>Children can be invited to take part in testing our games (playtests) with their parents&#39; or guardians&rsquo; authorization and/or their parents&#39; or guardians&rsquo; physical presence being required depending on the state where the playtest is conducted.</p>

<p>Parents must exercise their privacy rights for their children. Please refer to the &quot;Your rights&quot; section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

You can obtain more details and opt out of the sharing of your personal information to third parties for any purpose by contacting us through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameloft.com/zz/privacy-notice/contact-form" target="_blank">this form</a>.</p>

<p>If you have previously consented to any direct marketing communication from us or subscribed to our newsletters, you can unsubscribe by clicking on a link available in each communication and newsletter we send you.</p>

<p>If you want to decline to allow cookies or other tracking technologies, please read our Cookies Policy on our websites.</p>

<p>Please note that game functionality, Services and features can be affected by your actions. Some of your information and its processing is mandatory for Gameloft to provide the Services.</p>

<p>Your actions may force Gameloft to cease providing the Services. When the conditions below apply, your game will be reset:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you ask for the modification of this mandatory information, we may not be able to continue to link the game or game Services to you.</li>
	<li>If you request limitations to processing that are mandatory for Gameloft, or you object to such processing (in which case, we may not be able to provide you with the game or game Services).</li>
	<li>If you withdraw your consent or ask for the deletion of your information.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you withdraw your consent or ask for the deletion of your information, we will not use or process your information anymore but we will store it to answer regulatory or police requests. We also reserve the right to retain an archive of such information for a commercially reasonable time to ensure that its deletion does not affect the integrity of our data; and we further reserve the right to retain an anonymous version of such information.</p>

<p>Please specify your request through this <a href="https://www.gameloft.com/zz/privacy-notice/contact-form" target="_blank">form</a>.</p>

<p>If you are the parent of a child who is under 13 years of age (or under another age specified by applicable regulations) and believe your child has provided us with information, please fill out this <a href="https://www.gameloft.com/zz/privacy-notice/contact-form" target="_blank">form</a> and we will delete the information from our system.</p>

<p>To preserve the confidentiality of your information, we must be able to correctly identify you. For this reason, please provide us with a copy of an official document to prove your identity. This copy will be safely destroyed within two months of your request being received and closed.</p>

<p>Our team will look into your request and answer you within one month, unless your request requires further investigation. You&rsquo;ll be specifically informed if that is the case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>11 &ndash; Additional information for Californian users</h2>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) permits California residents to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information about the types of personal information the business has collected, shared with, and/or sold to third parties for a business or commercial purpose during the immediately preceding calendar year.</p>

<p>As a Californian consumer, you also have the right, at any time, to opt out of any type of selling of your personal information.</p>

<p>Please note that (other than in the two situations described immediately below) we do not sell your personal information to provide the game or game services described in this Privacy Policy. Our partners and providers who work with us may have access to your personal information in order to provide you with the game services within the limits and throughout the duration of our agreement, but they can&rsquo;t reuse your personal information for any other purposes. Our contracts are strictly drafted to protect your personal information and your privacy rights.</p>

<p><u>Exceptions</u></p>

<p>1) Gameloft is part of the Vivendi Group and we may sell your data for use in specific partnerships with Vivendi and other Vivendi entities.</p>

<p>2) As part of specific partnerships, we may sell your data to a limited number of third-party partners.</p>

<p>You can obtain a list of these Vivendi entities and third-party partnerships in this <a href="https://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice/contact-form-cali" target="_blank">form</a>. This list is updated regularly.</p>

<p>We will only sell the personal information of users who are 16 years of age or older, and you can opt out at any time by using this <a href="https://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice/contact-form-cali" target="_blank">form</a>.</p>

<p>As we do not sell the personal information of users who are less than 16 years old, only users who are 16 years old or older may opt out.</p>

<p>A person legally authorized to act on behalf of a user has the right to opt out for that user. We only provide this right to users who are 16 years of age or older, and we may ask them for a copy of an identifying document.</p>

<p>If you submit a request on behalf of another person, we may require a proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from them.</p>

<p>In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another person. Additionally, we will not honor your request when an exception applies, such as when the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another consumer or when the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA&rsquo;s access or deletion rights.</p>

<p>The exercise of any of the rights mentioned above will not have any discriminatory consequences for you.</p>

<p>To exercise your rights, please access this <a href="https://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice/contact-form-cali" target="_blank">form</a> or refer to the &ldquo;How to contact us&rdquo; section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

Therefore, please review this Privacy Policy from time to time so that you are aware when any changes are made to it.
