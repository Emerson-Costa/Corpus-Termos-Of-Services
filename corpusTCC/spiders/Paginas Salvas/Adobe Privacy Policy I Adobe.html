<p> </p>
<p><b>Sharing for Fraud Prevention Purposes</b></p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Adobe if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, as well as to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Adobe, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p> </p>

</ul>
<p>We may share or publish aggregate information that doesn’t specifically identify you, such as statistical information about visitors to our websites or statistical information about how customers use the Adobe Experience Cloud [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html].</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="website-applications"></a>Is my personal information displayed anywhere on Adobe’s websites or applications?</h3>
<p>There are several places within Adobe’s websites and apps that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, or submit content for others to see. Sometimes you can limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other users of the app or website. Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within an app or website that allows you to control who sees what you post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and app, your email address or name and/or profile photo may be included and displayed with your message. You can find more information about managing your public profile here [https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/edit-adobe-account-personal-profile.html/]</p>
<p>To remove content you have shared on our websites and apps, please use the same app or website feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact us [https://www.adobe.com/go/privacyinquiry].</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Is my personal information secure?</h3>
<p>We work hard to protect your personal information. We employ administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate, such as encryption, 2-step verification, and strict contractual obligations for employees and contractors.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="info-secure"></a>Where does Adobe store my personal information?</h3>
<p>Your personal information and files are stored on Adobe’s servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us.</p>
<p><a name="info-transfer" style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255);"> </a><br />
</p>
<h3>Does Adobe transfer my personal information across national borders?<br />
</h3>
<p>We may transfer your personal information across national borders to other countries in compliance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>If you reside outside of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Ireland. Adobe Ireland will transfer your personal information to some organizations and individuals which are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, namely the United States and India, and to all other countries in the world where our apps, and other products or services are available.</p>
<p>Where Adobe Ireland transfers your personal information to a country which is not within the EEA and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we rely on one or more of the following legal mechanisms: EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, and your consent in certain circumstances. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review upon request, using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. For more information about the certification of Adobe U.S. to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, including the scope of our certification, please see Privacy Shield/European data transfers [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html].</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What rights do I have in respect of my personal information and how can I exercise these rights?</h3>
<p>Under the law of some jurisdictions, you may have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this information to another controller.</p>
<p>In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (such as where we are using the information for direct marketing).</p>
<p>These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us.</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Adobe ID account), you can get in touch with us – or our data protection officer – using the details set out below. Additionally, many of our websites and apps allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the &quot;my account,&quot; [https://accounts.adobe.com/] &quot;my profile,&quot; or a similar feature of the app or website you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our websites and apps by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.</p>
<p>If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to your local privacy regulator or data protection authority and, where applicable, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with Adobe Ireland's lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission.</p>
<p>To register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID, and to use some Adobe websites, apps, products or services, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you, or provide you with the websites, apps, products or services requested. All other provision of your information is optional. Providing optional information will help us offer you a better experience, such as more personalized or tailored content or offerings.</p>

<h3>Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing</h3>
<p>The Adobe family of companies (see list of Adobe entities [https://www.adobe.com/about-adobe/contact/offices.html] and our acquired companies [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policies.html]) and companies we hire to help market our websites and apps on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to Adobe. </p>
<p>Where we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time by:</p>
<ul>
<li>updating your preferences in your Adobe ID profile;</li>
<li>updating your preferences in your specific website or app accounts;</li>

The information collected is stored on our computers for use by these business customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How long does Adobe retain my information?</h3>
<p>When you register for an Adobe ID account, we process and keep most personal information we have about you for as long as you are an active user of our products, services or apps. When you close your account, we begin deleting certain personal information that we no longer have a business reason to retain, such as your hashed password and your tokenized payment account data. However, we typically retain personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you for seven years after your last interaction with us.</p>
<p>Where we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in future.</p>
