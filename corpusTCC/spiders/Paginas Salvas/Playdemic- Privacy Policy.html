                                  	  One important use of your information is communication.

The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers.

After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Playdemic or a partnering SNS.

Such employees may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details and (ii) the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data or playing Playdemic games, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

   									Our websites and games may contain advertisements from companies other than Playdemic that may link to their own websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.

   									Playdemic implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and We are committed to the protection of customer information.
									  <br /><br />
									For user accounts registered directly with Playdemic profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Playdemic account, the website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL").
									  <br /><br />
									While We take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If your SNS account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorised play of your Playdemic games, so be careful to keep your account information secure. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please contact Us at <a href="mailto:privacy@playdemic.com">privacy&#64;playdemic.com</a>.
								      <br /><br />
									Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although We strive to protect your personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once We have received your information, We have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.
