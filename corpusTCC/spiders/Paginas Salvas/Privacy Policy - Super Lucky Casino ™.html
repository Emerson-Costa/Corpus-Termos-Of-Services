<p><em>Information
We Collect From Third Parties</em></p>



<p>We
may collect information about you or others through our affiliates or through
non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to register for an
Account through a social networking account. If you access the Service through
a social media account, you may allow us to have access to certain information
in your social media profile. This may include your user ID, name, email,
gender, birthday, current city, profile picture URL and the user IDs of your
friends who have also connected with our applications. We may also cache data
we receive from the Facebook APIs to improve our user experience. Social
networking sites have their own policies for handling your information. For a
description of how these sites may use and disclose your information, including
any information you make public, please consult the sites&#8217; privacy policies. We
have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal
information it collects about you.</p>



<p>We
may also collect information about you from non-affiliated third parties for
fraud or safety protection purposes, or for marketing purposes. For example, we
may receive information about your use of products/services offered by our
advertising partners. We may collect also collect information about you, such
as your name or email address, from third party websites or other sources from
which you download or access Super Lucky applications, services or products
that also make up part of the Service.</p>



<p>We
likewise may combine information that we collect from you through the Service with
information that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from
any other products or services we provide.</p>



<p><em>Information
We Collect Automatically</em></p>



<p>Device/Usage
Information: We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, web beacons,
and other tracking technologies to collect and store information about your use
of the Service. As described further below, we may collect and analyze
information including, but not limited to: (1) device type; (2) operating
system and version; (3) carrier provider; (4) IP address; (5) Media Access
Control (MAC) address; (6) International Equipment Mobile ID (IMEI); (7)
whether you are using a point package; (8) the game version; (9) the device’s
geo-location; (10) language settings; and (11) a unique device ID. In addition,
we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Service. This unique user
ID is stored in connection with your Account profile information to enable us
to move your information to a new device at your request. In addition, it may
be used to link a character with which you play our games to your username on
the Forums.</p>



<p><em>Log
Data, Cookies and Web Beacons</em></p>



<p>When
you browse certain portions of the Service, we automatically collect and record
standard user information and clickstream data about your visit (through the
use of cookies and otherwise) as part of our analysis of the use of the
Service. For example, when you visit or request a web page from our server, we
record the IP address of your machine, the time, date and URL of the request
and information about the browser being used, and other information regarding
the visit, such as the pages visited on the Service, the time spent on each
page, any advertisements clicked and any search terms used (collectively, “Log
Data”). Log Data may be aggregated and is used to monitor and analyze use of
the Service and to enable us to analyze traffic and trends, administer and
improve the Service, identify and keep track of errors and bugs, and gather
broad demographic information to become more familiar with where visits to the
Service originate, how often the Service is visited and what parts of the
Service are visited most often. We also share such information with third party
service providers assisting us with the foregoing and with our advertisers. For
example, some of this information is collected and used so that when you visit
the Service again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other
information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to
verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their
requests. We link Log Data to your information for tracking and analyzing our
customers’ use of the Service to help improve the Service, to tailor the
Service to their needs and to enforce our Terms of Service.</p>



<p>A
cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive.
Like many websites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional
website usage data, to improve the Service and in some cases to enable you to
more easily log in to your Account. We may combine information collected
through the use of cookies we issue with other information that you provide to
us. Super Lucky may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better
understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our
users and web traffic routing on the Service, and to improve the Service and
our other products and services. A session cookie enables certain features of
the Service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave
the Service. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may
be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies
can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most
Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.</p>



<p>We
may feature advertisements served by third party advertising companies which
deliver cookies to your computer or device so the advertisements you see can be
tracked. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service
in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>



<p>You
can instruct your web browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting
cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
If your browser is set to refuse all cookies, however, some features of the
Services may not function properly.</p>



<p>We
and third party advertising companies may collect information using Web
beacons. Web beacons or “gifs”, are electronic images that may be used on our
Site, in our Service or in our emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies,
count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
Advertisers may use web beacons in connection with our Service in order to
collect and use data regarding advertisement performance and your interests for
the purpose of delivering relevant advertising to you.</p>

<h4>3. <strong>How We Share the Information We Collect</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Advertising
     Partners</li></ul>



<p>We

ad targeting, tracking ad conversions or demographic profiling, or other
purposes related to providing the Services to you.</p>



<ul><li>Service
     Providers</li></ul>



<p>We

tasks on our behalf and we use good faith efforts to obtain their commitment
not to use your information for any other purpose.</p>



<ul><li>Business
     Partners</li></ul>



<p>We

officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not
limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Super Lucky or any
third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent
or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal,
unethical or legally actionable.</p>



<ul><li>Business
     Transfers</li></ul>



<p>We
may transfer your information in connection with a change or transfer of Super
Lucky’s ownership, or a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets
or in the event of bankruptcy, including in the course of diligence.</p>



<ul><li>Consent

<p>We
may share your information with your consent, including where you post
information to be shared publicly or with other users. For example, you may

applications or other forums (“Forums”). Certain of your information, such as
your username and other information, will always be publicly visible by other
users of the Forums, including when such users view your Account profile page.
Your email address will not be publicly visible unless you choose to make it
visible in your Account profile page. You may also direct us to share
information when you participate in player forums or message boards post comments
to other users’ profiles, send private messages or invitations to other users,
chat with other users, and post photos in your public Profile.</p>



<ul><li>Aggregated

<p>The
sharing scenarios identified above apply to personally identifiable
information, not aggregated or anonymous information. We may share aggregated
or anonymous information about you and other users with advertisers,
publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties, in which case
such information may be disclosed and used for a broad range of commercial
purposes without limitation.</p>



<h4 id="Analytics-and-tailored-advertising">4. Analytics and Tailored Advertising</h4>



<p>We
may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics
and Amplitude) on our Site to collect and analyze usage information through
cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist
with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google
Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google
Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</p>



<p>If
you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear
GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or
banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of
our communications and marketing campaigns.</p>



<p>The
Service may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the
delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Service, as well as on
other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based
on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting,
information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic
data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These
ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across
other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>



<p>Third
parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the
Service, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer,
mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed
above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such
as Google Analytics and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Service,
other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or
other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you
use to access the Service. We sometimes provide our customer information (such
as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in
de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary
IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other
websites and mobile applications.</p>



<p>We
neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies
or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to
access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested
in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can
generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored
advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">Network
Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/">Digital
Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or Y<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">our Online
Choices</a>&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from
companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics
for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit
the&nbsp;<a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Google Ads Settings page</a>. We do not control these
opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these
opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these
mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>



<p>Please
note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see
advertising when you use the Service, but it will not be tailored to you based
on your online behavior over time.</p>



<h4>5. <strong>EEA Data Subjects</strong></h4>



<p>The
laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground
they rely on to use or disclose your “personal data” (as defined in such
applicable laws).&nbsp; To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are
as follows:</p>



<ul><li>To
     honor our contractual commitments to you:&nbsp; Much of our processing of
     personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to
     take steps at users’ requests in anticipation of entering into a contract
     with them.&nbsp; For example, we handle personal data on this basis to
     allow you to play our games.</li><li>Consent:&nbsp;
     Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on
     the basis of your implied or express consent.</li><li>Legitimate
     interests:&nbsp; In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that
     it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities in ways that
     are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of
     the affected individuals. This includes: operating our business and the
     Service; providing security for our websites, products, software, or
     applications; marketing; receiving payments; preventing fraud; and knowing
     the customer to whom we are providing the Service.</li><li>Legal
     compliance:&nbsp; We need to use and disclose personal data in certain
     ways to comply with our legal obligations (such as our obligation to share
     data with tax authorities).</li></ul>



<h4>6. <strong>Retention of Your Information</strong></h4>



<p>We
generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes
above and in compliance with applicable law. The length of time for which we
retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it
and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.</p>



<h4>7. <strong>Security</strong></h4>



<p>Super
Lucky takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized
access or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties. Although we make
good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Service in a
secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot
guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or
its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity
and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security
measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to
this information. We do not warrant or represent that your Account or any of
your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by
third parties.</p>



<h4>8. <strong>Your Choices</strong></h4>



<p>When
you register for an Account or later access your Account, you will able to

and make publicly visible other pieces of your information, and the Service

with a legal obligation.&nbsp;If these rights apply to you, they may permit you
to request that we:</p>

     information which is out of date or incorrect</li><li>delete
     certain information which we are holding about you</li><li>restrict
     the way that we process and disclose certain of your information</li><li>transfer

<h4>10. <strong>Third Party Links</strong></h4>
