<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).  Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Information</strong></p>
<p>For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.  Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.  If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).  The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others</strong></p>
<p>We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q4</strong> – <strong>What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A4</strong> – As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information you submit to us.

<p>Removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers. We are not required to remove your posted content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it. Additionally, we do not have control over third parties (e.g. other users) who may have copied or reposted this information.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes or otherwise, unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>Q5</strong> – <strong>What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A5 –</strong> The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us.  We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use.  Those measures include: maintaining information collected online behind a firewall-protected server; encrypting username and password information; limiting access to personal information to only those employees performing a legitimate business function; storing users’ personal information on off-site servers separate from other corporate information and systems; notifying by email or posting a notice on our website if D3 Go! learns that a data breach has occurred. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.  However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.</p>

<p>Last updated <strong>January 22, 2019</strong></p>
<p>D3PUBLISHER OF AMERICA, INC.</p>
<p><strong>Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS “EULA”), WHICH IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, THE END USER (“YOU”), AND D3PUBLISHER OF AMERICA, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, “D3PA”, “WE” OR “US”), CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE MARVEL PUZZLE QUEST: DARK REIGN MOBILE GAME PROVIDED BY D3PA (THE “GAME”). BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE GAME, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, PLEASE DO NOT CLICK “ACCEPT” OR OTHERWISE DOWNLOAD OR USE THE GAME.</p>
<p>Terms of Use.  The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA. We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA. We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available. You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.</p>
<p>Scope of License.  This EULA is a non-exclusive, limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, terminable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules of the Mobile Platform Operator, or other terms and conditions applying to your mobile device. This EULA does not allow you to use the Game on any device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the terms and conditions relating to your device, you may not distribute or make the Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Game and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the Game before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this EULA and the terms and conditions for your mobile device), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Game or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any forgoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-source components included with the Game). Any attempt to do so is violation of the rights of D3PA and D3PA’s licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property.  All content included in the Game, including text, design, graphics, logos, user interfaces, button icons, images, photographs, audio clips, video clips, digital downloads, data compilations and software (but not including any content posted by users) is owned by D3PA or D3PA’s licensors and protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws. The Game may include registered and unregistered trademarks owned by or licensed to D3PA, which may not be copied, imitated or used, without the prior written permission of D3PA.</p>
<p>Charges.  If there is a charge associated with the Game, you agree to pay that charge. If the Game is free, there may still be charges for additional content within the Game, including virtual currency and virtual goods (both defined below), and you agree to pay those charges. You may be able to prevent purchase of such additional content by adjusting your mobile device’s settings. Certain devices may keep you logged on for a period of time after you download the Game (or after you make a purchase through the Game). This may allow a user (for example, a child) to incur charges without entering your password. This is a function of the software of these devices and not within our control. Prices for the Game exclude all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You may still incur charges incidental to using the Game even if the Game itself is free (for example, charges for internet access, text messaging, and other data transmission). You are solely responsible for the payment of such taxes or other charges related to your use of the Game. Any amounts paid for the Game or virtual items or virtual currency are non-refundable, except as expressly set forth in this EULA. You understand that all purchases and charges made by you are final. You are not entitled to any refund or return for products sold for any reason. Any election to honor a refund or return shall be made at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>Consent to Use of Data.  We may ask you to submit certain personal information in order to register a D3PA account. You agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, complete and current information. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, incomplete or not current, D3PA has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Game by you.  D3PA is committed to protecting your privacy.

<ul>
<li>Facebook connection is not required, but connecting the app with Facebook on a device allows the users save to be backed up in case something goes wrong with a device due to theft, damage or anything else. For this, we collect and store the Facebook ID connected through the Facebook app. There is also a user controlled message gifting system that is completely user controlled and sent through private messages only.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixpanel is a program we used to review user habits and game analytics using user_ID, username, advertising identifiers, and IP address. A user ID is a something that is created when the game is installed on a device and is only linked to the game while it stays on the device so that Customer Support can help fix players status. A username is created by the player and is the same as a user ID, it’s created when by the player and will be deleted if the game is deleted from the device.  Advertising identifiers are also created when the app is installed on a device for sending information to a user about sales that target a users habits.  The development team includes only a few people who are capable and in charge of reviewing the information to run reports displaying in graphs habits of players for the designers to work out what is and isn’t working in the game.   One of the main reasons for this is gathering info to find what players are interested in, what they are avoiding, what players are most interested in purchasing, etc. so that we can make educated decisions on what to work on next to improve, add to, or remove in the game.</li>

This is done so we can review if someone is abusing another player verbally in the game so we can take proper action against a user with proof.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>MARVEL – In some cases, when players opt-in, we share player in-game usernames with Marvel Entertainment, LLC to facilitate some contests and giveaways. Also, we occasionally post some messages in game related to MARVEL promotions.</li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Terms of Use.  The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA. We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA. We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available. You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scope of License.  This EULA is a non-exclusive, limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, terminable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules of the Mobile Platform Operator, or other terms and conditions applying to your mobile device.

You may be able to prevent purchase of such additional content by adjusting your mobile device’s settings. Certain devices may keep you logged on for a period of time after you download the Game (or after you make a purchase through the Game).

Prices for the Game exclude all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You may still incur charges incidental to using the Game even if the Game itself is free (for example, charges for internet access, text messaging, and other data transmission).

<p>Magic: The Gathering – Puzzle Quest</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS “EULA”), WHICH IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, THE END USER (“YOU”), AND D3PUBLISHER OF AMERICA, INC. (D.B.A. D3 Go!) AND ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, “D3PA”, “WE” OR “US”), CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE MAGIC: THE GATHERING – PUZZLE QUEST MOBILE GAME PROVIDED BY D3PA (THE “GAME”). BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE GAME, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, PLEASE DO NOT CLICK “ACCEPT” OR OTHERWISE DOWNLOAD OR USE THE GAME.</p>
<p>Terms of Use.  The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA. We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA. We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available. You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.</p>
<p>Scope of License.  This EULA is a non-exclusive, limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, terminable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules of the Mobile Platform Operator, or other terms and conditions applying to your mobile device. This EULA does not allow you to use the Game on any device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the terms and conditions relating to your device, you may not distribute or make the Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Game and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the Game before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this EULA and the terms and conditions for your mobile device), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Game or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any forgoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-source components included with the Game). Any attempt to do so is violation of the rights of D3PA and D3PA’s licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property.  All content included in the Game, including text, design, graphics, logos, user interfaces, button icons, images, photographs, audio clips, video clips, digital downloads, data compilations and software (but not including any content posted by users) is owned by D3PA or D3PA’s licensors and protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws. The Game may include registered and unregistered trademarks owned by or licensed to D3PA, which may not be copied, imitated or used, without the prior written permission of D3PA.</p>
<p>Charges.  If there is a charge associated with the Game, you agree to pay that charge. If the Game is free, there may still be charges for additional content within the Game, including virtual currency and virtual goods (both defined below), and you agree to pay those charges. You may be able to prevent purchase of such additional content by adjusting your mobile device’s settings. Certain devices may keep you logged on for a period of time after you download the Game (or after you make a purchase through the Game). This may allow a user (for example, a child) to incur charges without entering your password. This is a function of the software of these devices and not within our control. Prices for the Game exclude all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You may still incur charges incidental to using the Game even if the Game itself is free (for example, charges for internet access, text messaging, and other data transmission). You are solely responsible for the payment of such taxes or other charges related to your use of the Game. Any amounts paid for the Game or virtual items or virtual currency are non-refundable, except as expressly set forth in this EULA. You understand that all purchases and charges made by you are final. You are not entitled to any refund or return for products sold for any reason. Any election to honor a refund or return shall be made at our sole discretion.</p>

We may also use this information, as long as it is in a format that does not personally identify you, to improve our products or to provide new games or other applications to you. However, you reserve the right to opt out of any data collection, discontinue your use of our services, or modify or delete any stored data accessible to you at your convenience.  Data shared to D3 for Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook connection is not required, but connecting the app with Facebook on a device allows the user’s save data to be backed up in case something goes wrong with a device due to theft, damage, or anything else. For this, we collect and store the Facebook ID connected through the Facebook app. There is also a user controlled message gifting system that is completely user controlled and sent through private messages only.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Play Service is a tool that allows us to store your save data; this is done by collecting and storing the Google User ID. The save data using google play service is another means to back up the users content in case something goes wrong so customer support can fix the users game state.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Helpshift stores user name and device ID, for customer support reasons so if you write in to fix an issue we have the data to fix the issues reported. The users name is a name that the player creates to associate them in the game.  The device ID is something that is created when the game is installed on a device so the game developers and customer support can fix issues or reward the player when something goes wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Crashlytics is a program that gathers device information including hardware, id’s, Operating system, and physical location when a crash occurs to help tracking how the crash happened for the development team and testers to try and recreate the crash to attempt a fix for the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixpanel is a program we use to review user habits and game analytics using user_ID, username, advertising identifiers, and IP address. If, for example something isn’t working or players do not like an event, we record actions in the game to find what players are interested in, avoiding, most interested in purchasing, etc. so that we can make educated decisions on what to work on next to improve, add to, or remove in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Zendesk stores user name, device ID, and player game ID for customer support reasons so if you write in to fix an issue we have the data to fix the issues reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pubnub is a system we use in the game that collects your in game user name and your unique game ID so that we can review conversations only when needed. This is done so we can review if someone is abusing another player verbally in the game so we can take proper action against a user with proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Appsflyer – Advertising ID, such as IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) and Google Advertiser ID, and IP Address are shared with Appsflyer in order to attribute installs of the game to advertisements. Appsflyer also collects various other information, such as OS version, device model, and in-app events (e.g. occurrences of purchases), to help us further optimize our advertising campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>GameChangerSF – Device identifiers of some users are shared with GameChangerSF in order to create optimized ad campaigns and, in some cases, to send advertisements about in-game events, characters, or activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>DeltaDNA is a program we use to review user habits and game analytics using user_ID, username, advertising identifiers, and IP address. If, for example something isn’t working or players do not like an event, we record actions in the game to find what players are interested in, avoiding, most interested in purchasing, etc. so that we can make educated decisions on what to work on next to improve, add to, or remove in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration; Password.  When you register for a D3PA account, you will choose a user ID and password. It is your responsibility to keep your user ID and password confidential.

You agree that in the event that this EULA, your account or the Game is terminated for any reason, which may include, without limitation, our discontinuation for any reason of the applicable portion of the Game, you will forfeit all virtual currency and virtual goods, and we will have no liability to you for such forfeiture.</p>

<p class="p1">PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS “EULA”), WHICH IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, THE END USER (“YOU”), AND D3PUBLISHER OF AMERICA, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, “D3PA”, “WE” OR “US”), CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE ADVENTURE GNOME MOBILE GAME PROVIDED BY D3PA (THE “GAME”). BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE GAME, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, PLEASE DO NOT CLICK “ACCEPT” OR OTHERWISE DOWNLOAD OR USE THE GAME.</p>
<p class="p1">Terms of Use.  The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA. We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA. We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available. You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.</p>
<p class="p1">Scope of License.  This EULA is a non-exclusive, limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, terminable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules of the Mobile Platform Operator, or other terms and conditions applying to your mobile device. This EULA does not allow you to use the Game on any device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the terms and conditions relating to your device, you may not distribute or make the Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Game and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the Game before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this EULA and the terms and conditions for your mobile device), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Game or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any forgoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-source components included with the Game). Any attempt to do so is violation of the rights of D3PA and D3PA’s licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>
<p class="p1">Intellectual Property.  All content included in the Game, including text, design, graphics, logos, user interfaces, button icons, images, photographs, audio clips, video clips, digital downloads, data compilations and software (but not including any content posted by users) is owned by D3PA or D3PA’s licensors and protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws.

<p class="p1">Charges.  If there is a charge associated with the Game, you agree to pay that charge. If the Game is free, there may still be charges for additional content within the Game, including virtual currency and virtual goods (both defined below), and you agree to pay those charges. You may be able to prevent purchase of such additional content by adjusting your mobile device’s settings. Certain devices may keep you logged on for a period of time after you download the Game (or after you make a purchase through the Game). This may allow a user (for example, a child) to incur charges without entering your password. This is a function of the software of these devices and not within our control. Prices for the Game exclude all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You may still incur charges incidental to using the Game even if the Game itself is free (for example, charges for internet access, text messaging, and other data transmission). You are solely responsible for the payment of such taxes or other charges related to your use of the Game. Any amounts paid for the Game or virtual items or virtual currency are non-refundable, except as expressly set forth in this EULA. You understand that all purchases and charges made by you are final.

<p>Terms of Use.  The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA.

We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern.

<p><strong>Alien: Blackout</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS “EULA”), WHICH IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, THE END USER (“YOU”), AND D3PUBLISHER OF AMERICA, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, “D3PA”, “WE” OR “US”), CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE ALIEN: BLACKOUT MOBILE GAME PROVIDED BY D3PA (THE “GAME”). BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE GAME, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, PLEASE DO NOT CLICK “ACCEPT” OR OTHERWISE DOWNLOAD OR USE THE GAME.</p>
<p>Terms of Use.  The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA. We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA. We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available. You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.</p>
<p>Scope of License.  This EULA is a non-exclusive, limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, terminable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules of the Mobile Platform Operator, or other terms and conditions applying to your mobile device. This EULA does not allow you to use the Game on any device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the terms and conditions relating to your device, you may not distribute or make the Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Game and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the Game before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this EULA and the terms and conditions for your mobile device), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Game or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any forgoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-source components included with the Game). Any attempt to do so is violation of the rights of D3PA and D3PA’s licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property.  All content included in the Game, including text, design, graphics, logos, user interfaces, button icons, images, photographs, audio clips, video clips, digital downloads, data compilations and software (but not including any content posted by users) is owned by D3PA or D3PA’s licensors and protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws. The Game may include registered and unregistered trademarks owned by or licensed to D3PA, which may not be copied, imitated or used, without the prior written permission of D3PA.</p>
<p>Charges.  If there is a charge associated with the Game, you agree to pay that charge. If the Game is free, there may still be charges for additional content within the Game, including virtual currency and virtual goods (both defined below), and you agree to pay those charges. You may be able to prevent purchase of such additional content by adjusting your mobile device’s settings. Certain devices may keep you logged on for a period of time after you download the Game (or after you make a purchase through the Game). This may allow a user (for example, a child) to incur charges without entering your password. This is a function of the software of these devices and not within our control. Prices for the Game exclude all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You may still incur charges incidental to using the Game even if the Game itself is free (for example, charges for internet access, text messaging, and other data transmission). You are solely responsible for the payment of such taxes or other charges related to your use of the Game. Any amounts paid for the Game or virtual items or virtual currency are non-refundable, except as expressly set forth in this EULA. You understand that all purchases and charges made by you are final. You are not entitled to any refund or return for products sold for any reason. Any election to honor a refund or return shall be made at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>Consent to Use of Data.  We may ask you to submit certain personal information in order to register a D3PA account. You agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, complete and current information. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, incomplete or not current, D3PA has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Game by you.  D3PA is committed to protecting your privacy. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by D3PA’s <a href="https://d3go.com/legals/#online_privacy_policy">privacy policy</a>.

However, you reserve the right to opt out of any data collection, discontinue your use of our services, or modify or delete any stored data accessible to you at your convenience. Data Shared to D3 for Alien: Blackout includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appsflyer – Advertising ID, such as IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) and Google Advertiser ID, and IP Address are shared with Appsflyer in order to attribute installs of the game to advertisements. Appsflyer also collects various other information, such as OS version, device model, and in-app events (e.g. occurrences of purchases), to help us further optimize our advertising campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook &#8211; Advertising ID, such as IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) and Google Advertiser ID, and IP Address are shared with Facebook in order to attribute installs of the game to advertisements.</li>

<li>Helpshift stores user name, device ID, and player game ID for customer support reasons so if you write in to helpshift about an issue you have experienced in the game we can respond and collect data on the issue reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity Analytics tracks custom events about level completion and other things to review what players are doing, but the data doesn’t collect anything personal, just game habits as the player plays through the game to tell the people making it if players are completing all the levels, or stopping at some point. We use this data to see if we should make any improvements to the game to make it more difficult or easier, or if there is some issue that is causing the player to get stuck.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
