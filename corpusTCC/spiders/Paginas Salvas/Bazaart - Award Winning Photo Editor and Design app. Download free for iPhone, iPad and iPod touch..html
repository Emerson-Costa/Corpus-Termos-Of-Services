<h1>Bazaart Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>V2.26, Last Updated June 7, 2020</p>
<p>These terms of service govern your use of the Bazaart software, licensed to you by Bazaart Ltd. You can decide to reject these terms of service, and that you do not agree to them. However, if you do so then you shall have no right to use the software or services.</p>
<p>We develop software for photo editing. When using the software, we'll provide you access to content that we licensed from our partners, and allow you to search photos from all over the web. You own all the rights for your works, but if you do not have a specific permission to use an image, we can't provide you with that permission.</p>
<p>The content we licensed through our collections is provided with a license (as detailed in the full terms). If you import content from outside our collections (including via our web-search or custom fonts), you may do so, but you are required to receive permission from the copyright holders. This means that we don't claim any ownership of your images.</p>
<p>Also, we may allow you to backup your photos, or to share them with your friends via other social networks, all according to functionality of the services.</p>
<p>Please take note that when using our services some information may be processed by third parties: photos may be processed by image processing services, statistical information may be collected by our service providers and technical information may be collected for improving the service.</p>
<p>Lastly, this service is made on an AS-IS basis; we can't be held liable for any damage: not if your phone heats up and blows, not if your data is lost and not if your photos are published on the web publicly.</p>
<p>Please take the time to read the full terms of service, as they are the final and definite agreement we have.</p>

This means that you cannot use a cellphone you received from the workplace in order to install this application without your employer's consent; (iii) you are not a sex offender, nor have you been convicted with any violent crime or any crime against your children.</li>

</ol>
<h2><strong>Services</strong></h2>
<p>We offer the following services, each of them is a "service" by itself, and all are considered a "service" under this agreement.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
   <li>We may allow you to perform certain photo editing and manipulation services. These may be changed from time to time.</li>
   <li>We may allow you to publish your photos on the web. If you wish to do so, you can upload your photos to other services.</li>

   <li>We may allow you to add different filters, import content from selected vendors, or search the web for content. When you use our web-search function, you acknowledge that we cannot inspect each image's usage rights and licenses and therefore we cannot provide you with any guarantee that such image may be used and you assume all risks pertaining to such activity. Icons you import from the Noun Project through our shapes function are independently licensed under a Creative-Commons Share Alike license.</li>
   <li>We may allow you to incorporate your own fonts into your works, where you choose and manage the fonts. You should inspect the licenses for these fonts and see that you are permitted to use them in your works before uploading them to our service or distributing them to the public.</li>
   <li>We may also offer premium features for paid users. These may include advanced tools and access to more licensed content and graphic resources.</li>
   <li>We may allow you to backup your photos, either to your iCloud account or to another backup service. This service might be made available in part only for registered users, or only for paying users.<em></em></li>
