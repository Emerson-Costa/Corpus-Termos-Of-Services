<p>For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Data or Other Information associated with the particular email(s) you provide in your Privacy Request, and we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access to your Personal Data or Other Information or complying with your Privacy Request. For example, we may verify your Privacy Request by matching information you provide with our records, or you may be asked to log in to your online account (if applicable). We may request additional information to verify your identity depending on the nature of the Privacy Request and the sensitivity of the information sought, if you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect the security of your account is compromised.</p>
<p>You can use an authorized agent to submit your Privacy Request. If you use an authorized agent, in addition to verifying the Privacy Request itself (see above), we will also verify the authorized agent’s ability to act on your behalf (they should submit written permission to act on your behalf or a power of attorney).</p>
<p>Once we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your Privacy Request as appropriate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your Privacy Request. If we are unable to complete your Privacy Request in whole or in part, we will let you know why.</p>
<div id="otherInfo" class="notice_title">7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</div>
<div class="notice_sub_title">7.1 Updates to Privacy Notice</div>
<p>Dow Jones may periodically update this Privacy Notice without prior notice to reflect changes in our practices. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Notice to see when this Privacy Notice was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Notice will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Notice on the Dow Jones Services. We will notify you by posting a prominent notice on the Dow Jones Services indicating we have updated this Privacy Notice. Your use of the Dow Jones Services or your provision of Personal Data to us following these changes means you acknowledge you have read and accept the revised Privacy Notice.</p>
<div class="notice_sub_title">7.2 Do Not Track Disclosure</div>
<p>Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>
<div class="notice_sub_title">7.3 Transfers</div>
<p>Your Personal Data may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than in your country.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA, we will implement appropriate safeguards to protect your Personal Data as required if we transfer it outside the EEA.</p>
<div class="notice_sub_title">7.4 Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service</div>
<p>In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy notice, rather than this Privacy Notice. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p>
