<p>‚ÄòNONPERSONAL DATA‚Äô (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable.</p>



<p>‚ÄòPERSONAL DATA‚Äô (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‚Äòdata subject‚Äô); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
