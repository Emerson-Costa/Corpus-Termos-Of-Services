  <div class="h1">AI Factory Privacy Policy</div>
  <p>(last updated 7th July 2020) 
  <p>At AI Factory, we build analytics into our games to help us to improve them 
    to give the user the best possible game experience. This samples anonymous 
    non-personal data that simply allows us to find out what users do and do not 
    like. AI Factory fully respects the user's privacy and never collects information 
    that could be directly linked to the user. AI Factory also displays advertisements 
    to fund the creation of these games. This is all governed by the following 
    privacy policy:</p>
  <p> Unless explicitly given the opportunity to accept this policy inside an 
    app, please note that by using or otherwise accessing any AI Factory mobile 
    application, you are agreeing to this privacy policy. If you 
    do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not use or otherwise 
    access our applications.</p>    
  <p class="h1">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</p>
  <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is effective from 1st January 
    2020 and was enacted to provide California consumers with greater transparency 
    and control over their personal information.</p>
  <p>AI Factory, through using ads in some of our apps, disclose limited user 
    data to ad networks in order to provide users with targeted relevant ads. 
    Under CCPA, this constitutes selling of personal information, and therefore 
    we provide the required general opt out link in our apps. Outside of disclosing 
    this limited data to ad networks, AI Factory does not sell any user personal 
    information.</p>
  <p>To learn more about what limited data we disclose to ad networks, please 
    view the <a href="#ad_networks" class="textlink_news">Ad 
    Networks</a> section below, which also provides links to privacy policies 
    of the ad networks we use.</p>
  <p>You can find the opt out link in our ad-supported apps by clicking on the 
    &#147;Privacy &amp; Ads&#148; link on the bottom right of the intro screen 
    of each app, and then clicking on the &#147;California Consumer Privacy Act&#148; 
    button.</p>
	
	<p class="h1">GDPR</p>
  <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is effective from 25th May 
    2018. It is designed to strengthen rights to privacy and make sure that all 
    companies deal with all personal data covered by GDPR according to EU and 
    UK laws.</p> 
  <p>This Privacy Policy will show what information we collect, why and what it 
    is used for. We store data securely.</p>    
  <p class="h1">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</p>
  <p>AI Factory complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
    in the U.S. and does not knowingly collect personal information about children.</p>
  <p class="h1"><a name="anonymous_data"></a>Anonymous Data</p>
  <p>AI Factory may collect and use anonymous data, via Google Analytics (and 
    Google Analytics for Firebase). We cannot identify you from this data. The 
    data is pooled to give us general statistics on our audience and usage of 
    our apps. 
  <p>Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier &#151; a randomly generated 
    number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets 
    their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers 
    on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset. 
  <p> A link to Google's privacy policy is near the bottom of this page. 
  <p>For example, Google Analytics automatically samples a user's country and 
    city, chosen device language, device model and make, screen resolution, app 
    version being used, operating system version, mobile phone network. This pooled 
    data provides statistics that can help us determine, for example, where our 
    apps are being most commonly used, and on which devices. This can help us 
    determine how to update our apps going forward. 
  <p>Google Analytics also automatically collects data including app sessions 
    numbers, session lengths, screen visits, flow from screen to screen, and app 
    acquisition data (where a user came from to install an app). Alongside data 
    that is automatically collected by Google Analytics, we also collect our own 
    anonymous data on our app usage through Google Analytics. This includes game 
    settings chosen, game results and other general UI events. Taken together, 
    this data allows us to improve our apps in many ways. For example, if a high 
    proportion of users can&#146;t beat level 1 in our game, we need to make it 
    easier. Such data can also help us improve artwork in the game (by knowing 
    what styles are most popular), or help us determine default option settings. 
    We also collect data on which of our apps are installed, so that we have a 
    better idea of which apps might be popular with users of another of our apps. 
    We also track the effectiveness of our in-app cross promotions (promoting 
    our own other apps). 
  <p>We plan to provide an opt-out option in our apps for collection of this anonymous 
    data in the future. 
  <p>Apps of ours that also contain the Facebook SDK will provide us with just 
    anonymous pooled data from Facebook about users accessing the apps, such as 
    their country, city, language, gender and age, along with data about how the 
    Facebook components in the app have been used. It does not access any of the 
    other user behaviour or broader personal data that Facebook can collect. We 
    cannot access any information about a user's Facebook account as our apps 
    do not login into Facebook. Some older versions of our apps with the Facebook 
    share button on the intro screen have the Facebook SDK but latest versions 
    of our apps (with Facebook icon linking to their site or no Facebook icon 
    at all) have no Facebook SDK. 
  <p>None of this collected data can be linked to any individual, and it is pooled 
    to provide us with general usage and audience statistics. AI Factory reserves 
    the right to use the collected anonymous data ourselves or disclose it to 
    our partners.
  <p class="h1">Online Multiplayer</p>
  <p>Online Multiplayer in our Chess and Checkers apps use Google’s Firebase (Realtime Database and Cloud Functions) alongside Google Play Games accounts. Signing into multiplayer requires a Google Play Games account.</p>
  <p>The Firebase Realtime Database only contains basic data required to allow 
    multiplayer to work, such as a list of matches the user is part of, and the 
    details of each match. Only Google Play Games user IDs and Google Play Games 
    user names (both of which are anyway publicly available in the Google Play 
    Games system) are used to identify users in the database. We do not store 
    any other personal data for any users in the database (i.e. no real name, 
    no date of birth, no email address, etc). </p>
  <p class="h1">Crashlytics</p>
  <p>Some of our Free apps now use Google’s Firebase Crashlytics, which provides us with more detailed crash data in order to track down and fix problems in the apps. This system provides us with details such as device type, Android version, time of crash, and crash logs. The crash reports are anonymous and no personally identifiable data is sent to us.</p>
  <p class="h1"><a name="emailed_personal_information"></a>Emailed Personal Information</p>
  <p>Any personal information sent to us by email will be stored by our email systems. Your email address will be used to respond to your email and we may also ask if you would like to be a beta tester for one of our apps.
<p>We won't ask for any personal information that we don't need.
<p>If you have subscribed to our newsletter, we will hold your details and email newsletters to you a few times a year.
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter you can unsubscribe at any time using the link in any of our newsletters or otherwise sending an email to let us know.
<p>Any data that we do collect will be kept securely in accordance with the current and new data regulations. 
  <p class="h1">Your Access to Your Information</p>
  <p>It is your right to access information held about you. GDPR means we have 
    to provide you with a copy of all requested personal data AI Factory hold 
    about you within 30 days of receiving your request. 
  <p>If the data AI Factory hold on you is incorrect, you have the right to correct 
    this. You also have the right to "erasure" so if you don't want AI Factory 
    to have any of your information, we will remove any personal information AI 
    Factory hold on you.
  <p class="h1">Personal Information and Third Parties</p>
  <p>We keep sales data from third parties including Google Play, iTunes and Amazon 
    to review sales and provide refunds. We don't share your personal information 
    with third parties except where necessary to provide the service you are requesting 
    or where we are legally obliged.
  <p class="h1">Third Party Terms and Conditions</p>
  <p>Please note that certain third parties, including but not limited to application 
    stores, may be needed in order for you to access our mobile applications. 
    These third parties have their own privacy policies which AI Factory cannot 
    control.
  <p class="h1">Links to Third Party Sites or Games</p>
  <p>Our mobile applications are supported by advertisements, which provide access 
    to third party sites or apps.
  <p>Our mobile applications may provide access to third party social networking, 
    communication and search features. 
  <p>Please be aware that, if you use any of these links you will leave our app 
    and the page you go to will not be governed by our privacy policy. 
    We cannot be responsible for the privacy of any information you provide whilst 
    outside of our app. 
  <p>These third party sites or apps are not affiliated with or controlled by AI Factory. AI Factory are not responsible for their content or for the use of any information you may provide them.  Our links to these sites or apps does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those sites or apps or the people or companies responsible for them. 
  <p class="h1">Updates to this Policy</p> 
  <p>We may revise our privacy policy from time to time. When we 
    do, those changes will be reflected here (as accessed via our app pages on the relevant application store). Any significant change we make to data usage will 
    be drawn to your attention via our apps. We encourage you to review this privacy 
    policy from time to time. Your continued use of our applications 
    will signify your acceptance of the changes to this privacy policy. 
  <p class="h1"><a name="ad_networks"></a>Ad Networks</p>
    
  <p>Advertising in our apps is provided by a number of third party ad networks. 
    If GDPR applies to you, ads in our apps will default to being non-personalised 
    but you may be prompted to opt in to personalised ads. Ad networks who provide 
    adverts to our mobile applications may access identifiers assigned to your 
    device, such as Google Advertising ID, or unique device identifiers (none 
    of these IDs allow you to be identified as a person). 
  <p><b>Opting out of Personalised ads</b> <br>
    You can opt in or out of personalised ads at any time by visiting; <br>
    <b>Android devices:</b> <br>
    Settings&gt;Google&gt;Ads&gt;Opt out of ads personalisation <br>
    or <br>
    Android&gt;Google Settings&gt;Ads&gt;Opt out of ads personalisation<br>
    <b>Amazon devices:</b> <br>
    Settings&gt;Security &amp; Privacy&gt;Advertising ID, then turn off &quot;Interest-based 
    Ads&quot;.<br>
    <b>On iOS</b>, you may withdraw your consent by enabling the &#147;Limit Ad 
    Tracking&#148; setting. <br>
    If you opt out, you will still see ads, but they will not be personalised 
    for you. 
  <p>AI Factory choose to only provide ad networks with a minimal set of application 
    permissions required for these ads to function. We only use ad networks that 
    take their GDPR and CCPA obligations seriously and have implemented steps 
    needed to support GDPR and CPPA compliance. Each of their own privacy policies 
    are listed below.
