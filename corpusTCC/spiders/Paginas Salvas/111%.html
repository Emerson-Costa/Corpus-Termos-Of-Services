                        <br>a. Personal Information. We do not store Personal Information and therefore we do not disclose your

                        <b>Data Controller and Data Processor</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>In accordance with GDPR, we set our duty on data controller and data processor. Data controllers
                        decide the "purposes" and "means" of any processing of personal data. Similar to what's already in
                        place for data protection law today, data controllers will have to adopt compliance measures to cover
                        how data is collected, what it is being used for, how long it is being retained for and ensure that
                        people have a right to access the data held about them. Data processors handle personal data on behalf
                        of a data controller. Certain obligations now apply directly to data processors, and controllers
                        must bind them to certain contractual commitments to ensure that data is processed safely and legally.
                        <br>
                        <br>
