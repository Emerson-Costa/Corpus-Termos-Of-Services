    <p>Please note that this list is not exhaustive and that there may be other cases in which we share your data with third parties, where this is in Asmodee&#039;s legitimate interest, permitted by applicable law, or where it is required to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.</p>

    <h2><a href="#how-long-do-we-keep-your-personal-data">How long do we keep your Personal Data?</a></h2>
    <p>As a matter of principle, your Personal Data is only kept for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
    <p>Thus, when creating your Account, your identification data (surname, name, date of birth) as well as your personal data (e-mail address, country of residence) is kept for a period of <strong><u>seven (7) years</u></strong>, in the so-called active database, <u>from the date you last logged in</u>.</p>
    <p>Data related to the Services use (login data: time and place of your activities, username and IP address, data of the content communicated) is kept for a period of <strong><u>three (3) months</u></strong>, in the so-called active database, <u>from the date you last logged in</u>.</p>
    <p>Moreover, we may keep some of your data for a longer period of time, in particular when we are required to do so by law or when such data is required to prove a right or contract. This applies especially to your transaction data (invoices relating to the purchase of games and other Products), the number of transactions you have conducted as well as the date and time of these transactions).</p>
    <p>In this case, your Personal Data will be stored and kept for a period of <strong><u>five (5) years</u></strong> in compliance with the standard limitation period.</p>
    <p>This data will also be kept in Intermediate Storage for a period of <strong><u>ten (10) years</u></strong>, in compliance with our tax and accounting obligations.</p>
    <p>Once the storage periods have expired, we will ensure that your Personal Data is anonymized or deleted.</p>
    <p>However, in accordance with Article 5.6 of our Terms of Use and Services, your Content will be retained even after your Account and/or Personal Data has been deleted, with the understanding that your Content will remain associated with your former account. You may at any time request the specific deletion of this content under the terms of Section 8 of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<section id="security-of-your-personal-data">
    <h2><a href="#security-of-your-personal-data">Security of your Personal Data</a></h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of your Personal Data and we have established information system security policies as well as appropriate technical rules and measures to protect it from unauthorized access, modification, use, and disclosure or unlawful destruction or accidental loss.</p>
    <p>All our Partners, employees, Subsidiaries, consultants, and data subcontractors who have access to Personal Data and are involved in its processing are required to preserve its confidentiality.</p>
    <p>Password security</p>
    <p>We shall take all necessary precautions to ensure the secure storage of your password associated with your Account (storage encrypted by a strong one-way algorithm).</p>
    <p>However, the security of this password also depends on its design.</p>
    <p>Also, we remind you that for your password to be valid, it must be sufficiently complex and difficult to guess, even by someone who knows you well. When creating your Asmodee.net account via the Internet, we offer you a password quality analysis tool whose recommendations we ask you to follow.</p>
    <p>Password security</p>
    <p>All communications between the Applications and the Platform are carried out in a secure manner using the SSL/TLS protocol, identified by the appearance of a small padlock icon or equivalent in Internet browsers. This protocol protects you against spying during Personal Data transfers between Applications and the Platform.</p>
    <p>Security of the storage of personal data</p>
    <p>The Platform stores Personal Data on highly secured medium both logically (encrypted hard drives) and physically (secure access data centers).</p>

                <li><p>or to comply with a legal obligation. We are not obliged to comply with your request to delete your Personal Data, in particular if its processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to recognize, exercise, or defend legal rights.</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong><em>Limitation</em></strong>. You may ask us to limit the processing of your Personal Data (i.e., to retain it without using it) where:</p>
            <ol class="lower-alpha">
                <li><p>its accuracy is disputed;</p></li>
                <li><p>its processing is unlawful but you do not want it to be deleted;</p></li>
                <li><p>it is still required for the recognition, exercise, or defence of legal claims;</p></li>
                <li><p>we verify the existence of compelling reasons for exercising your right to object.

                <li><p>the processing is based on your consent;</p></li>
                <li><p>within the performance of an agreement made with you and that the processing is automated.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The right to the portability of your Personal Data must not infringe on the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong><em>Right to object</em></strong>. You may at any time, for reasons related to your specific situation, object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest.

            <p>You may at any time object to the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of prospecting.</p>
        </li>

            <ol class="lower-alpha">
                <li><p>access to the processing of Personal Data allowing "<em>the planning and arrangement of the deceased's estate</em>";</p></li>
