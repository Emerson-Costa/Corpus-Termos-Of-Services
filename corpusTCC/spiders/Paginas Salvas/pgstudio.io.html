    <div class="title">PRIVACY POLICY of Pridegamesstudio OU</div>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us, and we respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
        operating our Apps. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect and
        use your personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy supersedes any prior agreements or earlier versions of this Privacy Policy for the use of the
        Services.</p>
    <p>As long as we may collect and use your personal information, we intend to follow these principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where we collect and use your personal information, we do so by lawful and fair means and make our best
            effort to make the collection and use transparent for you.
        </li>
        <li>We limit collection and use of your personal data to the minimal extent needed for the specified purpose.
        </li>
        <li>We do not intend to identify our users, so we never use collected information with this purpose.</li>
        <li>In some cases you may be asked to provide us with your personal information, for example, if you sign in to
            our games using your Facebook or other third party credentials, we will use that service to authenticate
            you. You may always stop using such services for authentication and ask us to remove relating information.
        </li>
        <li>You are not required to provide personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so,
            in some cases we will not be able to provide you with certain opportunities of our Apps. We use the
            information we collect for the following purposes:
        </li>
        <li>In order to create and use your account, you may be asked to provide some information. For example, you may
            sign in to our services using your Facebook account, as described above. This is the only information you
            have to provide to create an account with us. This information is needed if you would like to retain your
            achievements and purchases, and this information is treated as personally identifiable information, so you
            may always ask us to stop using this information by contacting us <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bad2dfd6cafacaddc9cecfded3d594d3d594">[email&#160;protected]</a> But you should remember
            that if you ask us to delete your account, we will remove all data regarding you, your achievements and
            purchases from our database. If you do not ask us to remove your personal data from our database, we will
            retain it for some time.
        </li>
        <li>We use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or
            troubleshooting issues that you report to us. We also use your information to make improvements to our
            services. We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.
        </li>
        <li>We may use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including personalized content, and
            basic functionalities like tracking which language you speak.
        </li>
        <li>We use data for analytics to understand how our Apps are used.</li>
        <li>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our Apps. This includes detecting,
            preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, loss prevention, and technical issues that could
            harm our Apps, our users, or the public.
        </li>
        <li>Further you may find out which information we collect, what are the purposes thereof and how we treat
            collected information:
        </li>
        <li>Account. Where you want to create an account as described above, we will collect only your ID, so you may
            retain your achievements and purchases, for example, if you obtain new device. We do not intend to identify
            you by using your ID, but you may always ask us to delete it from our database.
        </li>
        <li>Usage information:

                <li>Services Metadata. When Users interact with the Services, metadata is generated that provides
                    additional context about the way Users use our Apps. For example, our games log the number of times
                    you access your App and the time of the day. This type of information is only collected in
                    anonymized or aggregated format, and is not personally identifiable.
                </li>

                    of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device
                    identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends
                    on the type of device used and its settings. This type of information is only collected in
                    anonymized or aggregated format, and is not personally identifiable.

                    format, and is not personally identifiable. We may, for example, use an IP address received from
                    your device to determine your approximate location.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            initial purposes of collection and use of your personal data without your explicit consent.

            parties usually have their own separate privacy policy. Therefore, we recommend you read the privacy policy
            of third parties carefully. We are not responsible or liable for the privacy policy of third parties. Please
