						<p>The origin of State Bank of India dates back to <span class="number_highlight">1806</span> when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In <span class="number_highlight">1921</span>, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India. In <span class="number_highlight">1955</span>, the controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the State Bank of India (SBI) came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial Bank of India . In the Indian Financial world, SBI is synonymous with trust and security.</p>
						<p>In line with recognized International Practice and for the information of customers and others who visit the Bank's website we believe it is necessary to post a privacy statement.
