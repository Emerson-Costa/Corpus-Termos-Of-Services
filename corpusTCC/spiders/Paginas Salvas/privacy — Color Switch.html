<meta name="description" content="Tether Studios Inc. (&quot;Tether Studios&quot;) is committed to protecting the 
privacy of its users (&quot;users&quot; or &quot;you&quot;). This Privacy Policy has been 
created to inform you about how Tether Studios manages, collects, stores 
and uses the information you provide in connection with any Tether Studios 
game or application (&quot;Service&quot;). Please note that the scope of this Privacy 
Policy is limited only to information collected by Tether Studios through 
your use of a Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection 
and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 
Tether Studios may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and Tether 
Studios encourages you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes. 
Information Collected Tether Studios' primary objective in collecting user 
information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to 
enjoy the Service. When you install any of the Services, Tether Studios may 
collect and record the information you provide to Tether Studios, whether 
through the Services or through social network or other third party 
services (&quot;Account Information&quot;). Personal Information “Personal 
information” means information about you that can be used to contact or 
identify you. The personal information types collected in accordance with a 
Service may vary depending on the activity and may include: Your name; Your 
social network or third party service user identification number; Your 
mobile device’s unique identifier (UDID); Transaction identifiers for 
purchases; Your email address; Your profile picture; or Any other relevant 
information included in your application, social network or other online 
profile. Additionally, Tether Studios may acquire information from you 
through: Your access and participation in message boards on a Service; The 
contents of your Customer Support requests; or Your purchase of a virtual 
product of any type. Please note that because a third party site manages 
the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, Tether Studios does 
not have access to your credit card details or billing information. 
Non-Personal Information “Non-personal information” is information that, 
when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. Tether Studios 
may collect non-personal information about your use of its Service both in 
the course of game play and software usage. Tether Studios may also invite 
you to share non-personal information about yourself which may include but 
is not limited to: Your age or date of birth; Your gender; Information 
about the hardware you may own; Your favorite websites, friend information 
and fan pages; or Any other information included in your application, 
social network or other online profile. If non-Personal Information is 
collected for an activity that also requires personal information, Tether 
Studios may combine your non-personal information with your personal 
information in an attempt to provide you with a better user experience, to 
improve the value and quality of the Services and to analyze how its 
Services are used. The Service may also record game play information such 
as your game session duration or your high scores. In addition to 
information collected as described above, you may choose to share 
additional information about yourself throughout the Service, such as on 
message boards and in games. Any actions you perform with other players are 
considered public, and are in your sole discretion. Other information 
Tether Studios may collect includes your occupation, language, zip code, 
area code, location, and the time zone where a Service is used, as well as 
information about your computer, mobile device, software, platform, 
incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control 
(MAC) address and connection, browser type, browser language, referring 
pages, exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, 
pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on 
particular pages, and the date and time of this activity, so that Tether 
Studios can better understand customer behavior and improve its products, 
services, and advertising. Tether Studios may also receive either 
non-personal or public information from third parties in connection with 
market and demographic studies and/or data that Tether Studios may use to 
supplement personal information provided directly by you. Use of Your 
Information How Tether Studios Uses Your Information Tether Studios uses 
your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders and to 
send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. In 
addition, the personal information you provide will allow Tether Studios to 
send you messages regarding, among other things, new products, features, 
enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of 
interest. You may also later opt out of certain of these communications. 
You may opt out of all communications from Tether Studios by sending an 
e-mail to:  contact@tetherstudios.com Tether Studios may also use personal 
and non-personal information, both individually and combined together, to 
better understand the behavior and preferences of its customers, to 
troubleshoot technical problems, to serve static and dynamic advertising, 
to enforce its Terms of Service, to ensure proper functioning of its 
products and services as well as to help improve Services and their 
content. In addition, Tether Studios may combine non-personal information 
with personal information, such as an email address, to administer loyalty 
programs, tailor its offerings, web pages or game play experience to you. 
By use of friend finder tools whether directly through the Service or 
through a social network or gaming service, you acknowledge that use of 
these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also 
allow your contacts to associate your Service account (and related gaming 
entitlements, including games played, wagers and coins) with your social 
networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends’ list will 
be subject to this privacy policy. If you choose to use a referral service 
to &quot;tell a friend&quot; about a Service, Tether Studios may ask you for your 
friend’s name and email address. Tether Studios will send your friend an 
email on your behalf or a text message inviting him or her to visit the 
relevant site or check out the Service. Tether Studios stores your friend's 
name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this 
email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not 
receive multiple copies of the same email message. Tether Studios does not 
keep or use this information for any other purpose. If you enter into a 
sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, Tether Studios may use the 
information you provide to administer those programs. Your participation in 
tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon you granting 
Tether Studios permission to collect, use, store, transmit and display 
publicly statistical data, such as your scores, rankings and achievements, 
generated through your participation. In all cases of data access and 
collection, the information you provide will not be disclosed, rented, 
loaned, leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated 
third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of providing you with 
and improving the Service and for any other purpose stated herein. Tether 
Studios will retain your information for as long as your account is active 
or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or 
request that Tether Studios no longer use your information contact Tether 
Studios at the email address provided in the Contact Us section below. Note 
that there may be instances where Tether Studios is legally required to 
retain your information. Access through Social Network Services or Mobile 
Devices By accessing the Service through a social network, mobile device or 
other third party platform or service or by connecting to such a third 
party network, platform or service via a Service, you are authorizing 
Tether Studios to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy 
Policy any and all information that you agreed the social network, mobile 
device or other third party platform could provide to Tether Studios 
through the social network/mobile device/third party platform Application 
Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third party 
social network, mobile device or platform. Your agreement takes place when 
you connect with the third party network, platform or service via the 
Service, and/or when you connect with a Service, or “accept” or “allow” (or 
similar terms) a Service to access your information through a social 
network, mobile device or other third party platform or service. Tether 
Studios may also collect or receive information about you from other 
Service users who choose to upload their email contacts. This information 
will be stored by Tether Studios and used primarily to help you and your 
friends connect. Third Party Service Providers Tether Studios may employ 
third party companies and individuals to facilitate its Services, to 
provide the Services on its behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without 
limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and 
improvement of the Services) or to assist Tether Studios in analyzing how 
its Services are used. From time to time, Tether Studios employs third 
party contractors to collect personal information on its behalf to provide 
email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest 
administration, credit card processing or other services through the 
Service. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your 
name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to its 
contractors. Tether Studios may ask some third party contractors, such as 
credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement 
personal information that you provide to Tether Studios for its own 
marketing and demographic studies, so that Tether Studios can consistently 
improve its sites and related advertising to better meet its visitors' 
needs and preferences. To enrich its understanding of individual customers, 
Tether Studios may tie this information to the information you provide to 
it. Message Boards and Chat Rooms Note that certain information you post 
and communicate through a Service or a third party site or service is 
public information for which you have no expectation of privacy. You may 
choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing 
user generated content to Tether Studios sites or Services or in its chat 
rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar 
forums on its sites through mobile services and/or through third party 
sites or services. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is 
public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or 
confidentiality. You should be aware that any personally identifiable 
information you submit in the course of these public activities can be 
read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used 
to send you unsolicited messages. Tether Studios is not responsible for the 
personally identifiable information you choose to make public in any of 
these forums. If you post a video, image or photo through a Service for 
public view, you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, 
copied and/or used by other users without your consent. Tether Studios is 
not responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to post 
through a Service. Please see Tether Studios’s Terms of Service at 
http://www.questioncubeapp.com/termsofservice on this point and for other 
guidelines about posting content through any Service. Browser Use Note that 
in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be 
sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and 
analytics companies. Tether Studios has no control over the information 
sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and 
recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the 
disclosure of information you would not like to share. Disclosure of Your 
Personal Information You understand and agree that Tether Studios may be 
required to disclose any personal information if required to do so by law 
or in the belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid 
liability, to comply with legal process, including, but not limited to a 
subpoena, statute, search warrant, or court order, or to protect the 
property and rights of Tether Studios or a third party, to protect the 
safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity Tether 
Studios may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical 
or legally actionable. Note that Tether Studios is not required to question 
or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar 
governmental request that it may receive. Tether Studios may also disclose 
information about you if it determines that such disclosure is reasonably 
necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Service or to protect 
its operations or users. Additionally, Tether Studios may sell, transfer or 
otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal 
Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or 
sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. Cookies Like many websites, 
Tether Studios may use &quot;cookies&quot; to collect information. A cookie is a 
small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your 
mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to 
a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. 
Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for 
purposes such as improving the quality of Tether Studios’s service, 
tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to 
use. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies 
on your browser. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web 
browser’s options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before 
accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept 
cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or 
functionalities of a Service. Links The Service may contain links to other 
websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website or 
application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not 
mean that Tether Studios endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it 
a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on 
a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, 
you will leave the Tether Studios site you are visiting or application you 
are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third 
party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files 
on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal 
information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules 
regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to 
them. Because Tether Studios cannot control the activities of third 
parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal 
information by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will 
adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Tether Studios. You 
are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of 
other websites and applications you visit before providing any personal 
information. Changing or Deleting Your Information You may review, update, 
correct or delete any personal information by changing the applicable 
information in your profile page. If you completely delete all of this 
information, your account may be deactivated. If you would like Tether 
Studios to delete your record in its system, please contact Tether Studios 
and it will attempt to accommodate your request if it is not legally 
obligated to retain the record. Security Tether Studios has made reasonable 
technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal 
information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, 
alteration or disclosure. However, Tether Studios cannot guarantee that 
unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or 
use your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that 
email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so Tether Studios 
discourages you from sending Tether Studios personal information through 
these media. Policy Regarding Persons Under 21 This product is intended for 
use by those 21 or older for amusement purposes only. Without derogating 
from the foregoing, Tether Studios does not knowingly collect personal 
information from people under the age of 13. If Tether Studios learns that 
a person under the age of 13 has provided it with personal information, 
Tether Studios will take steps to delete such information as soon as 
possible. Payments For Tether Studios’s policy regarding the purchase of 
“coins” or other virtual currency, please see Tether Studios’s Terms of 
Service. Contacting Us For any questions about its Privacy Policy or any 
other issue please contact Tether Studios at: contact@tetherstudios.com" />

Your resulting friends’ list will be subject to this privacy policy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you choose to use a referral service to "tell a friend" about a Service, Color Switch may ask you for your friend’s name and email address. Color Switch will send your friend an email on your behalf or a text message inviting him or her to visit the relevant site or check out the Service. Color Switch stores your friend's name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email message. Color Switch does not keep or use this information for any other purpose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, Color Switch may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon you granting Color Switch permission to collect, use, store, transmit and display publicly statistical data, such as your scores, rankings and achievements, generated through your participation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In all cases of data access and collection, the information you provide will not be disclosed, rented, loaned, leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of providing you with and improving the Service and for any other purpose stated herein.

This information will be stored by Color Switch and used primarily to help you and your friends connect.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Third Party Service Providers</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Color Switch may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate its Services, to provide the Services on its behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services) or to assist Color Switch in analyzing how its Services are used.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From time to time, Color Switch employs third party contractors to collect personal information on its behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing or other services through the Service. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to its contractors. Color Switch may ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to Color Switch for its own marketing and demographic studies, so that Color Switch can consistently improve its sites and related advertising to better meet its visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich its understanding of individual customers, Color Switch may tie this information to the information you provide to it.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Message Boards and Chat Rooms</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Note that certain information you post and communicate through a Service or a third party site or service is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to Color Switch sites or Services or in its chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on its sites through mobile services and/or through third party sites or services. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Color Switch is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to make public in any of these forums.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you post a video, image or photo through a Service for public view, you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent. Color Switch is not responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to post through a Service. Please see Color Switch’s Terms of Service at http://www.colorswitch.co/termsofservice on this point and for other guidelines about posting content through any Service.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Browser Use</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Note that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. Color Switch has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You understand and agree that Color Switch may be required to disclose any personal information if required to do so by law or in the belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, including, but not limited to a subpoena, statute, search warrant, or court order, or to protect the property and rights of Color Switch or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity Color Switch may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. Note that Color Switch is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that it may receive.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Color Switch may also disclose information about you if it determines that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Service or to protect its operations or users. Additionally, Color Switch may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cookies</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Like many websites, Color Switch may use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of Color Switch’s service, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to use. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of a Service.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Links</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Service may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that Color Switch endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Color Switch site you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Because Color Switch cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Color Switch. You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit before providing any personal information.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may review, update, correct or delete any personal information by changing the applicable information in your profile page. If you completely delete all of this information, your account may be deactivated. If you would like Color Switch to delete your record in its system, please contact Color Switch and it will attempt to accommodate your request if it is not legally obligated to retain the record.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Security</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Color Switch has made reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, Color Switch cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so Color Switch discourages you from sending Color Switch personal information through these media.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Policy Regarding Persons Under 21</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This product is intended for use by those 21 or older for amusement purposes only. Without derogating from the foregoing, Color Switch does not knowingly collect personal information from people under the age of 13. If Color Switch learns that a person under the age of 13 has provided it with personal information, Color Switch will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Payments</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For Color Switch’s policy regarding the purchase of “coins” or other virtual currency, please see Color Switch’s Terms of Service.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Contacting Us</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For any questions about its Privacy Policy or any other issue please contact Color Switch at:</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">support@colorswitch.co</h3></div></div></div><div class="col sqs-col-3 span-3"><div class="sqs-block spacer-block sqs-block-spacer sized vsize-1" data-block-type="21" id="block-b8fe3c8ffaa18afe083d"><div class="sqs-block-content">&nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div>
