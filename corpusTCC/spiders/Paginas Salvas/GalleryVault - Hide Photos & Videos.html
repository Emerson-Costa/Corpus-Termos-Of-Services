We may also associate a name with a phone number through the numbers tagging functionality, which allows a user who receives a call from a phone number which is not associated with a name in the database to indicate a name to be associated with that number. A name will only be associated with a number through this functionality if a sufficient number of independent Users, based on our algorithm, have indicated the same name for the relevant number.
