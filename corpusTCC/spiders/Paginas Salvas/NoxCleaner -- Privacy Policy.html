                <p>Nox Limited, and its subsidiaries* (“Bignox.com”, “Nox” or “we”, or “our” or “us”),
                    cares about the privacy of your personal information and is committed to protecting it.
                    This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you and why, what we do with that
                    information, and how we handle that information.</p>
                <p>Information which permits us to identify you directly or indirectly is considered personal data in
                    the European Union (EU) according to the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
                    (GDPR).
                    To the extent we collect and process any personal data that is covered by the EU GDPR,
                    we will do so in accordance with the requirements of the EU GDPR.
                    The principles of data protection not apply to anonymous information,
                    namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to
                    personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer
                    identifiable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, you can visit Nox on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information
                    about yourself.
                    To the extent that you do provide information to Nox, Nox will never sell, rent or disclose your
                    personally identifiable information to outside parties for their own marketing purposes without your
                    consent. With your permission, Nox may send you e-mail regarding our new products, upgrades, or
                    select third party products.
                    We do not disclose your personally identifiable information to such third parties.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="block-subtitle">What type of information is collected from you?</h2>
                <p>
                    Nox only collects personal information which is reasonably necessary for its dealings with the
                    individuals to whom the information relates.
                    The types of personal information Nox collects will depend on the particular dealings we have with
                    you. However,
                    generally, we collect and hold personal information about existing and prospective customers, our
                    third party service providers and suppliers,
                    and employment applicants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally, Nox collects personal information directly from the individuals concerned.
                    For instance, there are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Web
                    Sites.
                    This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a Nox or third party product
                    from our Web Sites.
                    When you download the products we require you to fill out a form with your name and email address.
                </p>
                <p>Nox may also collect personal information about individuals indirectly from third parties,
                    such as from our business partners,
                    from third party providers of marketing lists,
                    and through various other methods, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies</li>
                    <li>Referrers</li>
                    <li>IP addresses</li>
                    <li>System information</li>
                </ul>
                <p>None of these methods can be used to identify, or reasonably identify,
                    you with the exception of cookies,
                    which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Web Sites.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="block-subtitle">How and why is your information used?</h2>

                    In general, you can visit our website without providing us with any personal information.
                    However, there are instances where we must have your personal information in order for us to grant
                    you access to our protected and secured sites.
                    This information may include registration data (your name, address, email address, phone number,
                    title, etc.),
                    information request data and response data ("User Information"). When you receive your confirmation
                    email or when you receive any email from the list server,
                    you will be given instructions on how to remove yourself from the list.</p>

                <h2 class="block-subtitle">Use of User Information</h2>
                <p>We intend to use such information for purposes of supporting your relationship with Nox by designing
                    content that is suitable to your needs and alerting you to new product and service offerings as they
                    become available.
                    This User Information may be retained by Nox to verify compliance with the agreement between Nox and
                    your employer,
                    to keep track of the domains from which people visit us,
                    to create a user profile to better serve you, or to simply contact you either electronically or
                    otherwise.
                    If you decide that we should not use your personal User Information to contact you,
                    please let us know and we will not use that information for such purpose.
                    However, please do not submit any User Information if you are less than 18 years of age.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="block-subtitle">Disclosure of User Information</h2>
                <p>Nox does not sell, trade or transfer User Information to third parties.
                    However, we may share User Information with our business partners for marketing,
                    advertising or product/service offering purposes. We disclose User Information if: we have your
                    consent;
                    we need to share it in order to provide you with the products and/or services you requested;
                    we respond to a court order or you violate our Terms of Use.
                    You may separately agree to provide your personal information to third parties that provide content
                    for Nox offerings,
                    in order to access and/or use their products and/or services.
                    If you agree to provide such information to these third parties, then your personal information will
                    be subject to their privacy policies.
                    In the case of a personal data breach, we will without undue delay and, where feasible, not later
                    than 72 hours after having become aware of it,
                    notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority and also communicate it to the data
                    subject.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="block-subtitle">Accuracy and Security</h2>
                <p>The accuracy and security of the User Information is important to Nox.
                    If you contact us to correct your User Information,

                    steps to protect it from unauthorized access and use of that personal information.
                    We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security
                    appropriate to the risk, including pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data.
                    We also put in place the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial policies and procedures to
                    secure your personal User Information. We continue to implement procedures to maintain accurate,
                    complete and current User Information. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your User
                    Information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet,
                    we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our
                    systems or otherwise in our care，is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p>

                    Nox uses "cookies".
                    The use of cookies is an industry standard,
                    and you'll find cookies at most major websites.
                    A cookie is a small data file that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to keep records
                    of the visits to such site.
                    A cookie contains information, such as your User Information,
                    that helps us recognize the pages you have visited and improve future visits,
                    but the only personal information a cookie can contain is the information that you provide yourself.
                    A cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites.
                    If you prefer not to accept a cookie, you can set your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to warn
                    you before accepting a cookie.
                    You can still access most of the features on our website even without accepting a cookie.
