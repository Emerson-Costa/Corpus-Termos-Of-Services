   <p>Games2Win collects Personal Information and other information regarding its current, prospective, and former clients, customers, users, visitors, and guests (collectively “<strong>Individuals</strong>”).</p>
   </div>
  
  <h1><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></h1>
   <div id="txtContainer">
   <p>The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from third-party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Games2Win and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Games2Win may collect Personal Information include:</p>
   </div>
   
	
	<p><li>you may provide Personal Information directly to Games2Win through interacting with the Services, participate in Services feedback, questionnaires, surveys, or contests or participating in forums discussions, and requesting Services, or information; and</li></p>

	<p><strong>3.	<u>Send Push Notifications</strong></u></p>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>Games2Win may occasionally use push notifications through Games2Win’ mobile applications to send you game updates, high scores and other Services-related notifications that may be important to you. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<p><strong>4.	<u>Use Anonymous and Aggregated Information</strong></u></p>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>We may use Personal Information and other information about you to create anonymized and aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access our Services or other analyses we create. Anonymized and aggregated information is used for several functions, including the measurement of visitors’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and we may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, Analytics and any other legally permissible purposes. We may share this information within Games2Win and with third parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h1><strong>HOW WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h1>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>We may share the information we collect about you in various ways, including:</p>
	</div>
	
	<p><strong>1.	<u>Service providers</strong></u></p>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>We may share any information we receive with Service Providers. The types of Service Providers (processors) to whom we entrust Personal Information include Service Providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Services. Games2Win has executed appropriate contracts with the Service Providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>2.	<u>Other players and users</strong></u></p>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>Social features are a core component of our games. Other players and users may, for example, see your profile data, in-game activities and read the messages you have posted.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p><strong>3.	<u>Marketing - Interest-based or targeted advertising and third-party marketing.</strong></u></p>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>Through our Services, Games2Win may allow third-party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect the following information within our Services:</p>
	<ul>
	<p><li>performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);</li></p>
	<p><li>certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as Advertising ID and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);</li></p>
	<p><li>other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length); and</li></p>
	<p><li>pseudonymous data, not directly identifying information (e.g., OS name and versions, device models, time stamp).</li></p>

	<p>These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) to measure how effective ads are for delivering targeted advertisements to you about our games within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based or targeted advertising.” We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.</p>
	
	
	</div>
	<p><strong>4.	<u>Disclosures under applicable law</strong></u></p>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate: (i) to comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) to respond to your requests; (iii) to protect yours, ours or others’ rights, property or safety; (iv) to enforce Games2Win' policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Games2Win; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.</p>
	<p>In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes—e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies, so they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.
	</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>5.	<u>Merger, sale, or other asset transfers</strong></u></p>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, Games2Win will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<h1><strong>INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING  </strong></h1>
	<div id="txtContainer">
	<p>We work with third party advertising partners like Google, Apple and their partners. We may share certain of your information with these partners to make advertising more relevant, measure its effectiveness, and help recognize your devices and serve ads.
