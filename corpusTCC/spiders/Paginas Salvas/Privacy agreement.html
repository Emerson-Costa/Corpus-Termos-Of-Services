            This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which Foxnovel, operating the Foxnovel service (“Foxnovel”, “we,” or “us”)as well as all related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service”) collect, use, disclose and otherwise process Personal Information. “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.        </div>
        <div class="one">
            In Foxnovel, we pay great attention to your private information. We hope you will understand how Foxnovel uses your information while using Foxnovel services. Therefore, I hope you will take the time to read the following policy carefully.        </div>
        <div class="one">
            Information collected or received from you        </div>
        <div class="one">
            We collect and process basic information for running our business and provide our service to you. You can usually choose what information you want to provide, but in some cases we need to require some certain information which help not only you use but also us provide service.        </div>
        <div class="one">
            We collect or receive information in a few different ways, depending on what services you use and how you use them:        </div>


        <div class="one">
            1. Information provided by you        </div>
        <ul class="six two">
            <li>
                We collect information you provide when you create a Foxnovel account, upload content, or otherwise use the service, including:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        a. Identification information. For example, your email address, username, and authentication credentials used to sign up or log in. If you choose to add a photo, location, or other optional details to your profile, you should be aware that such information is public, and therefore visible to anyone who visits your profile page. And in the future, we will launch the online personal home page. It may also be visible to anyone who visits your personal home page, although we will provide the invisible setting option.                    </li>
                    <li>
                        b. Information about trading in Foxnovel. If you purchase or carry out other transactions (such as exchanging commodities in real) in Foxnovel, we will collect information about these purchases or transactions. This information includes your payment information, such as order information of Google play and Apple store, and distribution and contact information, such as Full name, Country, State, Province, Region, City, Address line, Email address, Zip code and Phone number. We use this information to check your consumption and logistics distribution.                    </li>
                    <li>
                        c. The using situation of you. We collect how you use the information of our product, such as the content and type of activities, the functions used, the operation of the execution, the accounts interacting with others and your online time, frequency, and length of your online time. This information enables us to optimize our product services and allow you to recognize products.                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>                     
        </ul>
        <div class="one">
            2. Information collected from the service you use            <ol>
                <li>
                    We collect information about you and the devices you use to access the service, such as your computer, mobile phone, or tablet.                </li>
                <li>
                    The information that we collect includes:                </li>
                <li>
                    a. Device information. We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Foxnovel may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Foxnovel user account.                </li>
                <li>
                    b. Log information. When you use our services or view content provided on the service, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:                </li>
                <li>
                     Details of how you used our service, such as your search queries, reading history, bookmarks, and transaction history;                </li>
                <li>
                     Internet protocol (IP) address;                </li>
                <li>
                     Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL;                </li>
                <li>
                     Cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Foxnovel user account.                </li>
                <li>
                    c. Location information. When you use a location-enabled device, we may collect and process information about your approximate location, like the GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine approximate location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers, for advertising, analytics, or to protect access to content that is geo-locked due to regional licensing restrictions.                </li>
                <li>
                    d. Unique application numbers. Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Foxnovel when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic or required updates.                </li>
                <li>
                    e. Local storage. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.                </li>
                <li>
                    f. Cookies and anonymous identifiers. We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our services, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Foxnovel features that may appear on other sites.                </li>
            </ol>
