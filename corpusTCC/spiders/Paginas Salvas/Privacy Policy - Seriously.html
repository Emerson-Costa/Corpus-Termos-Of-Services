<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This Privacy Policy will be effective from January 1, 2020. </span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light, serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">Introduction</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In this Privacy Policy, “Seriously” refers to Seriously Digital Entertainment OY and its “Affiliates”, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership. We may also refer to Seriously as &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Seriously is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and provide them a better social gaming experience (&#8220;users&#8221; or &#8220;you&#8221;). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This Privacy Policy applies whenever you play our games or otherwise access any of our other products, services, content, Seriously.com and/or the other domains provided by Seriously, together referred to as “Services.” This Privacy Policy describes:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #5a5a5a;"><span style="color: #0070c0;"><u>what information we collect, how we collect it</u></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #5a5a5a;"><span style="color: #0070c0;"><u>how we use that information and with whom we share it</u></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #5a5a5a;"><span style="color: #0070c0;"><u>how you can access and update that information and means of communication</u></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #5a5a5a;"><span style="color: #0070c0;"><u>how do we protect children’s privacy</u></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #5a5a5a;"><span style="color: #0070c0;"><u>how we protect the information we store and share about you</u></span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">By using the Service, you agree to the collection, disclosure, storage and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want Seriously to collect, store, use or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you should not play Seriously’s games or use our Services. Seriously may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and Seriously encourages you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to access personal information held about themselves. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with applicable law.</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri Light, serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">Information We Collect, How We Collect It and The Legal Basis for It.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Seriously only collects Personal Information to the extent necessary to fulfil one or more of its functions and activities and will do so only by fair and reasonable means. Generally, we will collect Personal Information directly from the users, but in some circumstances (including as outlined below), it may be necessary for us to collect information from a third party source.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The legal basis for collecting and using the information depends on what the information is and the context in which we collect it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Generally, we’ll normally process your personal Information for legitimate interest of efficiently fulfilling our contractual and legal obligations, account management, management reporting (including at our corporate group level), market review and analysis, promotion of our products and services and business development. In some cases, the processing is necessary to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms of Service) or to fulfill legal obligations, or to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, another user).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If we ask you to provide information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we are requesting your information (for example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in accordance with our Terms of Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing information is mandatory.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Every correspondence with you is logged and stored within our systems. When you provide us additional information other than the information mentioned in this policy (such as information revealing health or medical condition), you give us your explicit consent to process it for the intended purpose. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We do not sell personal information of our users and have not done so in the preceding 12 months. We also do not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by &#8220;opting in&#8221; to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you are a user residing in California, a list of the categories of personal information collected about you, and disclosed for a business purposes, generally and in the preceding 12 months, is detailed in Annex 1, along with the purposes of collection, categories of sources and categories of third party disclosures. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> .</span></span></span></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><b><span style="color: #5a5a5a;">Information About You That We Get from Third-Party Applications, Including Social Networks (like Facebook)</span></b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you play Seriously’s games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our Services to any third-party applications, including social networks like Facebook, Seriously may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the Seriously game you’re playing, the third-party application, your privacy settings and, if applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that third-party application.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For example, Seriously may collect and store some or all of the following information shared by the provider of the connected third-party application:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">your first and last name;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">your profile picture or its URL;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">your user ID number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo, and your friends’ identifiers;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">the user ID number and other public data of your friends;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">the login e-mail you provided to that third-party application when you registered with it;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">your physical location and that of the devices you use to access our Services;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">your gender;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">your birthday and/or age range;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">information about your activities on or through the connected third-party application;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">other publicly-available information on the third-party application; and/or</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">any other information that you or the provider of the third-party application share with Seriously.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you access our Services from a third-party application or connect our Services to a third-party application, you should also read that third-party application’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.</span></span></span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Like many websites, Seriously and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use tracking technologies such as &#8220;cookies&#8221; to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of Seriously’s Service, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to use. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Third party advertisers on the Services may also use, place or read cookies or other technologies as described below on your browser, and those practices are subject to their own policies. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies, to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all features, portions or functionalities of the Service.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We and our service providers may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us or our advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, including: </span></span></span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to Seriously, we will use it to respond to customer support inquiries, and keep you informed of your in-game activity, including comments from friends, let you know about in-game status and promotions as well as tell you about gift and neighbor requests. Some messages, like invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (e.g. text messages) (&#8220;Promotional Communications&#8221;) directly or in partnership with other parties, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication will offer you choices about receiving additional messages. Receipt of such communications depends on Seriously having certain contact information from you.

<p><span style="color: #484848;"><span style="font-family: inherit, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Though our Services do not target children, we may collect age information before allowing a user to proceed to certain games.
