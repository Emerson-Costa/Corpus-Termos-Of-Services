				</p><p class='T5P11' ><strong>ADP Privacy Code for Client Data Processing Services Principles</strong></p><p class='T5P12' >
					The ADP Privacy Code for Client Data Processing Services is based on a set of data protection principles outlined below.
				</p><p class='T5P13' ><strong>Data Processing Purposes</strong></p><p class='T5P14' >
					ADP shall Process Client Data on behalf of the Client, only in accordance with the Service Agreement, pursuant to any documented instructions received from the Client, or as needed to comply with Applicable Law.
				</p><p class='T5P15' >
					ADP processes personal data (including Special Categories of Data) pertaining to client employees as needed to provide client services, client support activities, as required by EEA applicable law and for the following additional purposes:
				</p><p class='address  addr1' >
					     a. Hosting, storage, and other processing needed for business continuity and disaster recovery;
				</p><p class='address  addr2' >
					     b. System and network administration and security, including infrastructure monitoring, identity and credential management, verification and authentication, and access control;
