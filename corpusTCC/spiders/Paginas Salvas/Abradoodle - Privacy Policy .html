            <h3>4. Who Can See Your Data </h3>
            Apart from Absolute Games, your data can be accessed by others in the following situations: <br/><br/>
            
            <strong> A. Other Users</strong> <br/>
            Other players and users may read the messages you have posted publicly to third party services.<br/><br/>

            <strong> B. Partners Working For Absolute Games </strong><br/>
            Absolute Games has partners to perform services for us. These partners process your data only at and according to Absolute Games's instructions to provide the Service, such as hosting, player support, advertising, analytics and fraud prevention.<br/><br/>

            <strong> C. Other companies and public authorities</strong> <br/>
            In order to combat fraud and illegal activity, we may exchange data with other companies and organizations and provide it to public authorities in response to lawful requests.<br/><br/>

            We may also disclose your data based on your consent, to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our players or others.<br/><br/>

            <strong> D. Advertising</strong><br/>
            The Service may contain advertisements from “Third-Party Services,” meaning companies other than Absolute Games may link to their own websites, online services, or mobile applications. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Third-Party Services. If you have any questions about how these Third-Party Services use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.

            Our Service is global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Policy. Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.

            Individual Rights<br/>
            <i>Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold</i><br/>
            You have the right to request that Absolute Games disclose the Personal Information it collects, uses, and discloses about you to third parties. There are two types of Right to Know requests you can make:
        </p>
        <p>
            Right to Know (Abbreviated Request): If you make a Right to Know (Abbreviated Request), you will receive the following information about you:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Category of personal information collected, </li>
                <li>Categories of sources from which that information was collected, </li>
                <li>The business or commercial purpose(s) for which the information was collected,</li>
                <li>The categories of third parties to whom Absolute Games sold or disclosed the category of personal information for a business purpose, and</li>
                <li>The business or commercial purpose for which Absolute Games sold or disclosed the category of personal information.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Right to Know (Specific Pieces of Information Request): If you make a Right to Know (Specific Pieces of Information Request), you will receive the following information about you:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Specific pieces of Personal Information collected about you. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Absolute Games does not sell any Personal Information of California consumers. This information will be provided to you free of charge, unless Absolute Games determines that your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You may request this information twice in a 12-month period. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Right of Deletion</i><br/>
            You have the right to request that Absolute Games and our service providers delete any Personal Information about yourself that Absolute Games has collected from you upon receipt of a verifiable request. This right is subject to exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Submitting Requests</i><br/>
            You may submit a request through a webform available by emailing us at ccpa@absolutegames.com or send us a request to our support center inside our game.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Verifying Requests</i><br/>
            Absolute Games provides California Consumers with the ability to submit requests through our request website, our telephone number, and our email address. Absolute Games must verify that the person requesting information or deletion is the California Consumer about whom the request relates in order to process the request.  To verify a California Consumer’s identity, we may request up to up to three pieces of Personal Information about you when you make a request to compare against our records.  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  We will only use Personal Information provided in your request to verify your identity and will delete any information you provide after processing the request.  Absolute Games reserves the right to take additional steps as necessary to verify the identity of California Consumers where we have reason to believe a request is fraudulent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Authorized Agent</i><br/>
            You may choose a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf to submit your requests (“Authorized Agent”). If you choose to use an Authorized Agent, Absolute Games requires that you provide the Authorized Agent with written permission to allow them to submit your request and that you verify your identity directly with Absolute Games. Failure to do so may result in Absolute Games denying your request.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Right to Equal Service</i><br/>
            Absolute Games will not discriminate against you because you exercised any of your rights, including, but not limited to, by:<br/>
            <ul> 
                <li>Denying goods or services to you.</li>
                <li>Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.</li>
                <li>Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you.</li>
                <li>Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>8. California Privacy Rights: Shine the Light</h3>
            Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide certain personal information in connection with obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses.  If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year.
        </p>
        <p>
            To obtain this information please contact us at the information provided below.  We will provide the requested information to you pursuant to the contact information provided to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>9. How Do We Protect Your Data</h3>
            <strong>A. Security Safeguards</strong><br/>
            In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration. <br/><br/>

            <strong>B. Data retention</strong><br/>
            We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data. Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>10. Age Limits</h3>
            Generally speaking, most of our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 for children located in the European Countries) (collectively, “Children”). Children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from Children. <br/>
            Though our Services do not target Children as the primary audience, we may collect age information before allowing a user to proceed for certain Services. For users who identify themselves as Children in our age-gate on such Services, if we allow Children to use the Services, we will either provide a version of that Service that does not collect, use, or disclose “personal information” (as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)), except as permitted by COPPA, or obtain legally valid parental consent.<br/><br/>
            If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information that is not subject to a COPPA exception from a Child, we will delete that data as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under the age of 16, please contact us.<br/>
