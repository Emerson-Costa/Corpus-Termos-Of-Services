<li>The Type of Information We May Collect</li>
</ol>

Additionally, you may be able to select a user name and/or in-game character name (collectively, &ldquo;User Name&rdquo;).

All of our Promotions are intended for people who are the age of majority in their respective state, province, or country unless otherwise expressly stated. In all cases where required, Promotions will have official rules or guidelines that outline what information is being collected or users will be directed to the most recent version of this Policy. In some cases, the information collected will be used only to administer the Promotion; in other cases, the information collected will be used for INFIPLAY&rsquo;s or sponsor&rsquo;s marketing purposes. Your information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes and/or in accordance with this Policy. Your entry in the Promotion may also result in your being added to our mailing lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on our Website, such as on a winner&rsquo;s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes.
