<h3>4.2. In-game advertising (i.e. when you view ads in Our Games)</h3>

Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using Advertiser ID; <br />keep track of what games you have used to market you similar kinds of games.

Ad network then excludes these players from seeing the ad; <br />marketing games to a group of potential players.</p>
