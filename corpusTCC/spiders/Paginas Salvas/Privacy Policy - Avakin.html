<h3>3. <strong>Why We Collect Information About You</strong></h3>



<p><strong>To provide our Games to you</strong></p>



<p>We will use information about you (including Basic Information, Third Party Log In Information, Analytics and User Content) for delivering our Games to you under the terms of use agreed between us. The processing of information in this way is necessary for us to record your progress and current status within a Game, and to ensure the Games deliver the features promised and function properly, so that you have the best experience when playing any one of our Games.</p>



<p><strong>To help us improve the Online Services and fix any problems</strong></p>



<p>We may process information about you (including Basic Information, User Content and Analytics) so that we can analyse and improve our Games and Online Services.</p>



<p>This processing is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of (i) ensuring that our Online Services function properly so that you and other users have the best experience when playing any of our Game(s) and using the other Online Services; (ii) improving the quality of our Online Services, and providing a better experience to our users; (iii) identifying and correcting any bugs in the Games and Online Services and (iv) understanding the effectiveness of our marketing to attract new users and re-engage our current users at an aggregated level.</p>



<p><strong>To respond to your enquiries and requests for support and to enable you to use the Forums</strong></p>



<p>We may process Contact Information so that we are able to properly respond to your enquiries and support requests either via the Support Centre or Forums or through <a href="mailto:privacy@avakin.com">privacy@avakin.com</a> and so you are able to use the Online Services, in accordance with the terms of use agreed between us.</p>



<p><strong>To acquire new users and engage current users</strong></p>



<p>We may process information (including some Advertising Data, Influencer and Analytics) in order to pursue our legitimate interests to encourage engagement from our less active users and to notify them with new virtual items or other promotions on offer.</p>



<p>We may also process this information to pursue our legitimate interests of acquiring new users for our Games as part of which we use unique links to let us know where our users have come from.</p>



<p>We use various forms of marketing to acquire new users. The information we collect about you may be used to improve the relevancy of our marketing, including the creation of ‘lookalike’ audiences. This allows us to offer more relevant marketing to potential new service users without using information that personally identifies you. In particular, we  may use some third parties to support us with online marketing. We provide limited information about you to the relevant social media platform through their tools (in particular, Facebook Custom/Lookalike Audiences) such as your name and email address so the social network can find users with similar characteristics to you, who may also be interested in our games. This processing is carried out only if you have given your consent.  You may withdraw your consent at any time.</p>



<p>We may also process your postal address, if you choose to provide it, in order to send you parcels if you have won a prize.  We process this information in order to perform our contractual obligations to you.</p>



<p><strong>To improve the monetisation of the Games</strong></p>
