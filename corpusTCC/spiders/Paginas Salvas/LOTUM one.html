	    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    Lotum one GmbH, Am Goldstein 1, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany ("Lotum one" or
	    "we") respects and protects your personal data.
	</p>
	<p>
	    With the following privacy policy, we want to inform you in more detail
	    about the data collection, processing and use in connection with the
	    website, the games and the related in-app services of Lotum one ("offers").
	</p>
	<p>
	    Lotum one collects, processes or uses personal data exclusively within the
	    applicable legal framework. Therefore, the high data protection level of
	    the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) holds true.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>1. </strong>
	    <strong>Field of application</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    This privacy policy is directed at all users of our services ("users").
	    Insofar as individual services of Lotum one have different privacy
	    policies, these apply.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Likewise, third-party services to which the service may refer by so-called
	    links are excluded from the field of application. Lotum one is not
	    responsible for their content or compliance with any data protection
	    regulations. This includes, for example, links to social networks such as
	    LinkedIn and Xing. The processing of users' personal data via these social
	    networks is carried out by the respective network operator without us
	    having any influence on such processing. This also applies to the personal
	    data that the user communicates to us via such a platform, for example by
	    contacting our user profile in the respective social network. Information
	    on the use and protection of the user's personal data on these platforms
	    can be found in the privacy policy of the respective platform.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>2. </strong>
	    <strong>
	        Collection, processing and usage of data when accessing the website
	    </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    2.1. When you visit the Lotum one website, information transmitted to us by
	    your web browser will be recorded automatically. This includes the IP
	    address of the device you are using, the date and time (including time
	    zone) of the particular access to the website as well as the information
	    which specific page or file you requested, the domain via which the
	    particular request was made (so-called referrer URL) and the operating
	    system and browser you are using.
	</p>
	<p>
	    2.2. Lotum one collects this data for the purpose of providing the website
	    on the basis of Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR, whereby the legitimate
	    interest of Lotum one is the provision of the website.
	</p>
	<p>
	    2.3. Lotum one may also use the aforementioned data to ensure proper
	    functioning of Lotum one's website, particularly for IT security purposes.
	    The basis for this collection and processing is Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f)
	    GDPR, whereby the legitimate interest of Lotum one is to ensure the
	    security of the website.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>3. </strong>
	    <strong>Cookies</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    3.1. The Lotum one website uses cookies. Cookies are small text files which
	    store settings and data on the user's terminal device for transmission to
	    Lotum one and which are transmitted each time the user accesses the Lotum
	    one website. Cookies enable Lotum one to identify your terminal device and,
	    if present, to load your presettings immediately.
	</p>
	<p>
	    3.2. Cookies are used by Lotum one to make the website more user-friendly
	    and effective, in particular by storing presettings selected by the user
	    during the visit and by providing Lotum one with information on the use of
	    the website and other statistical information. Cookies are only set with
	    the user's consent (Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. a) GDPR).
	</p>
	<p>
	    3.3. Some cookies will be deleted automatically when you close your
	    browser. Other cookies remain stored for 2 years and are automatically
	    deleted afterwards.
	</p>
	<p>
	    3.4. In general, the user can adjust his browser so that he is notified
	    about the setting of cookies, or that the setting of cookies is prohibited
	    for certain cases or in general, or that the user only permits the setting
	    of cookies in individual cases. In addition, the user can delete stored
	    cookies in the settings of his browser. However, if cookies are
	    deactivated, the functionality of Lotum one's website may be limited.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>4. </strong>
	    <strong>Downloading mobile apps</strong>
	    <br clear="all"/>
	    When downloading a mobile app from Lotum one, the owner of the platform on
	    which the app is provided (e.g. Apple Inc. for the AppStore and Google LLC
	    for the Google PlayStore and Amazon.com Inc. for the Amazon Appstore)
	    collects the following data: User name, email address, customer number of
	    the account, time of download, payment information and the individual
	    device code number. However, the platform owner is exclusively responsible
	    for this collection. To the extent necessary for the download, Lotum one
	    processes the data provided by the platform owner.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>5. </strong>
	    <strong>
	        Collection, processing and usage of data for the fulfilment of
	        contractual obligations, consent when using registration via single
	        sign-on services
	    </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    5.1. Lotum one collects, processes and uses personal data to fulfil
	    contractual obligations, i.e. within the framework of concluding a contract
	    with the user about the usage of the service, the execution of the contract
	    and the termination of the contract, including the billing of paid elements
	    of the service. Lotum one will not pass on personal data to third parties
	    if there is no legal basis or legal obligation and the user has not
	    consented.
	</p>
	<p>
	    5.2. Personal data that Lotum one may collect in order to fulfil its
	    contractual obligations with the user includes, depending on the service,
	    the name, address, gender, age, email address as well as IP address and
	    data for identifying the user's terminal device. The provision of this data
	    is not required by law, but is required for the conclusion of the user
	    contract for the respective Lotum one service. The user may voluntarily
	    transmit further data to Lotum one as part of the service. The basis of
	    this data processing for the fulfilment of contractual obligations is Art.
	    6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
	</p>
	<p>
	    5.3. Lotum one may offer the user the opportunity to register for
	    individual "Facebook Connect" offers of the social network Facebook,
	    operated by Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA
	    (hereinafter: "Facebook"). An additional registration is therefore not
	    necessary if the user does not want this. To log in, the user is redirected
	    to the Facebook page, where he can log in with his user data. This links
	    the Facebook profile of the user and our offer. The link automatically
	    transmits the following information from Facebook to Lotum one: name.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Lotum one only uses the name of the user of this data. This information is
	    absolutely necessary for the conclusion of the contract in order to be able
	    to identify the user.
	</p>
	<p>
	    For more information about Facebook Connect and the privacy settings,
	    please see the Facebook Privacy Notice and Terms of Use.
	</p>
	<p>
	    For transmission to the United States, the EU Commission has issued an
	    adequacy decision (No. 2016/1250) according to which companies that meet
	    certain criteria guarantee an adequate level of protection, also known as
	    the "EU-US Privacy Shield". These companies are listed in the so-called
	    "Privacy Shield List" or "Privacy Shield List". Facebook is one of the
	    companies listed there. The transmission to Facebook in connection with
	    Facebook-Connect is based on Art. 45 GDPR.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user is free to choose whether to log on to Lotum one with Facebook
	    Connect. If the user chooses to do so, the legal basis for the data
	    processing associated with the use of Facebook Connect is the user's
	    consent pursuant to Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. a) GDPR.
	</p>
	<p>
	    5.4. When using the service, Lotum one collects information on the type and
	    extent of its use ("usage data") in order to ensure proper gameplay within
	    the terms of the contract. Usage data in this context includes, in
	    particular, information for the identification of the user (such as name),
	    information regarding the beginning and end as well as type and extent of
	    the respective use and information about the products and services used by
	    the user. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1
	    lit. b) GDPR.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Lotum one may also use this data to identify and eliminate malfunctions or
	    abuse of the offer. This data processing is carried out on the basis of
	    Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR. The legitimate interest of Lotum one is to
	    ensure the proper functioning and use of the offer.
	</p>
	<p>
	    5.5. For the payment processing, the necessary usage data as described
	    above are collected and processed. Lotum one is currently working with
	    Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft as payment service providers. Aside
	    from this, Lotum one will not pass on user data or the content of private
	    messages in connection with the use of the service to third parties, unless
	    this is required by law or the user has consented. The legal basis for data
	    processing for the processing of payments is Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. b)
	    GDPR.
	</p>
	<p>
	    5.6. Lotum one is authorized to transmit or store personal user data at
	    locations in other member states of the European Union, or in other states
	    which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and at
	    locations in other states which guarantee an adequate level of data
	    protection, provided that the user consents thereto or this is legally
	    permissible.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>6. </strong>
	    <strong>Data processing in connection with ad-financed services</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    Individual offers (such as individual games or other individual services)
	    may be wholly or partly financed by advertising. In the case of services
	    financed by advertising, advertising is displayed instead of payment to be
	    paid by the user for the provision and use of the service to the user
	    during the use of the service in order to finance the provision of the
	    service. For the insertion of advertising, data for the identification of
	    the user's device (IP address, individual device ID of the device or
	    identifier), which is used to use the offer, is processed. Currently, Lotum
	    one does not display any personalized advertising in the European Economic
	    Area. The processing of data for advertising and transmission to service
	    providers is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>7. </strong>
	    <strong>Analytics tools</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    To optimize the service, Lotum one uses analytics tools that allow an
	    evaluation of the use of the service. This can be done by using cookies,
	    web beacons or tracking pixels. The cookies used for this purpose store
	    settings and data to be exchanged with the Lotum one service (e.g. data on
	    the user's terminal device or usage behavior) and transmit this data each
	    time the service is accessed. Web beacons or tracking pixels are
	    single-pixel files that link to Lotum one's services, enabling Lotum one to
	    evaluate the user's behavior. The analytics tools collect and process data
	    to identify the user's terminal device (such as IP address; for individual
	    services also the individual advertising ID of the terminal device).
	</p>
	<p>
	    Some of these analysis tools transfer data to the USA where it is stored
	    for further processing. The user can withdraw his consent to the use of all
	    these services by adjusting the corresponding settings in his terminal
	    device or as described in more detail in the presentation of the individual
	    services below. The transmission of the user's personal data to the
	    aforementioned providers of analytics tools takes place on the basis of
	    Art. 28 GDPR. The legal basis for the use of the analytics tools is Art. 6
	    par. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR. The legitimate interest of Lotum one is the
	    improvement and further development of the service. In particular, this
	    requires knowledge and statistical evaluations about the use of the service
	    and potential crashes of the apps.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Lotum one uses the following analytics tools:
	</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>
	        Swrve
	    </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	    Lotum one uses the web analytics tool SWRVE by New Game Technologies
	    Limited, t/a Swrve New Media UK, Suite 2.03, The White Collar Factory, 1
	    Old Street Yard London EC1Y 8AF, United Kingdom.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user can withdraw his consent to the collection and storage of his data
	    at any time by sending an email to games@lotum.de
	</p>
	<p>
	    Further information on Swrve's privacy practices is available to the user
	    at https://www.swrve.com/company/privacy-policy
	</p>
	<p>
	    Swrve is obliged to comply with the requirements of the GDPR due to its
	    main establishment being located within the EU. The transmission to Swrve
	    is therefore based on Art. 28 GDPR.
	</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>
	        Adjust
	    </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	    Lotum one also uses the web analytics tool adjust by Adjust GmbH,
	    Saarbrücker Str. 37A, 10405 Berlin. Adjust uses IP and Mac addresses of the
	    user in anonymized form for its analysis. The identification of a natural
	    person is thus made impossible.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user can withdraw his consent to the collection and storage of his data
	    at any time by following the opt-out instructions provided at
	    https://www.adjust.com/opt-out/
	</p>
	<p>
	    Further information on Adjust's privacy practices can be found at
	    https://www.adjust.com/privacy-policy/.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Due to its main establishment being located within the EU, Adjust is
	    obliged to comply with the requirements of the GDPR. The transmission to
	    Adjust is therefore based on Art. 28 GDPR.
	</p>

	    <li>
	        Fabric Crashlytics
	    </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	    Lotum one uses fabric crashlytics, a service provided by Google (1600,
	    Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). When using this
	    analytics tool, not only the above-mentioned data but also data on crashes
	    of the service as well as the crash report, the information provided during
	    installation of the app and device information (information on hardware and
	    operating system) are processed. The data collected by fabric crashlytics
	    may also be sent to Google servers outside the EU such as the USA.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user can withdraw his consent to the use of the data collected through
	    the use of fabrics crashlytics at any time by sending an email to
	    games@lotum.de
	</p>

	    https://fabric.io/terms and https://fabric.io/dpst.pdf.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The transmission to Google servers in the USA in this context is based on
	    Art. 45 and 28 GDPR. Google is one of the companies listed in the so-called
	    "Privacy Shield List" or "Privacy Shield List", which ensures an
	    appropriate level of data protection on the basis of an adequacy decision
	    by the EU Commission (No. 2016/1250).

	<p>
	    The user can withdraw his consent to the collection of the aforementioned
	    data by Google at any time by sending an email to games@lotum.de
	</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>
	        Flurry
	    </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	    Lotum one uses the analytics tool Flurry by Oath (EMEA) Limited (5-7 Point
	    Village, North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland), which makes it possible to
	    analyze application performance and app usage by using cookies. The
	    information obtained through the cookies may also be transferred to a
	    server of Oath (EMEA) Limited outside the EU such as the USA.
	</p>
	<p>
	    All data collected by Flurry to identify the terminal device (such as the
	    ID for advertisers of the device) will be replaced by a Flurry-specific
	    code immediately after its collection and then be erased.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Oath provides Lotum one with the collected data exclusively in an
	    aggregated form.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user can withdraw his consent to the collection of the aforementioned
	    data by Flurry at any time by following the instructions in the opt-out
	    link provided by Flurry at
	    https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/end-user-opt-out.html

	</p>
	<p>
	    A transfer to Oath servers only takes place after Lotum one has ensured
	    that a data protection level comparable to that in the EU is guaranteed by
	    a contractual agreement. Any transmission to Oath servers in the USA in
	    this context is based on Articles 46 and 28 GDPR.

	    ("UWG").
	</p>
	<p>
	    8.2.<strong> </strong>Lotum one may collect and evaluate statistical data
	    on the use of the service in aggregated or anonymized form for the
	    development of advertising, for market research purposes, to improve the
	    existing range of services and to develop new products.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>9. </strong>
	    <strong>Facebook Plugin</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    9.1. Lotum one integrates the social plugin of the social network
	    facebook.com in parts of the service. This social plugin is offered by
	    Facebook (4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland).
	    When the user accesses content included in this service which contains such
	    a social plugin from Facebook, the user's terminal device creates a direct
	    connection to Facebook's servers, which may also be located in the USA.
	    Facebook directly transmits the content of the social plugin to the user's
	    browser, which then integrates it into the website of this service. Lotum
	    one therefore has no influence on the extent of the data that Facebook
	    collects with the help of this social plugin and informs the user according
	    to his own level of knowledge: By integrating the social plugins, Facebook
	    receives Information on when the user accesses the service. If the user is
	    logged in to Facebook during this time, Facebook can assign the usage to
	    the user's Facebook account. If the user interacts with the social plugins,
	    for example by clicking the "Like" button or making a comment, the
	    corresponding information is transmitted directly from the user's device to
	    Facebook and stored there. If the user is not a member of Facebook, it is
	    still possible that Facebook stores the IP address of the user's device,
	    but according to Facebook, only an anonymized IP address is stored in
	    Germany. If the user is a member of Facebook and does not want Facebook to
	    collect data about him or her via this service and link it to the user data
	    stored on Facebook, the user must log out of Facebook before using the
	    service. For further information on the purpose and extent of data
	    collection and the further use of the data by Facebook, as well as your
	    rights and options to protect your privacy, please refer to the Facebook's
	    own privacy policy under the following link:
	    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" class="breakHard">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>. Lotum one points out that the user
	    can block social plugins for his browser with the help of browser add-ons.
	</p>
	<p>
	    9.2. For the transmission of data to the USA, there is an EU Commission
	    adequacy decision (No. 2016/1250) according to which companies that meet
	    certain criteria guarantee an adequate level of protection, also known as
	    the "EU-US Privacy Shield". These companies are listed in the so-called
	    "Privacy Shield List". Facebook is one of the companies listed therein. The
	    data transmission to Facebook connected to the social plugin is based on
	    Art. 45 and 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to
	    provide the best possible service based on the wishes and preferences of
	    our users.
	</p>
	<p>
	    9.3. The legal basis for using this social plugin is the user's consent
	    according to Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. a) or Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
	    Our legitimate interest is to provide the best possible service based on
	    the wishes and preferences of our users.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>10. </strong>
	    <strong>Twitter Plugin</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    10.1. Lotum one integrates the social plugin of the social network Twitter
	    in parts of the service. This social plugin is offered by Twitter (795
	    Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA). When the user
	    accesses content included in this service which contains a Twitter button,
	    the user's device creates a direct connection to Twitter's servers. Twitter
	    directly transmits the content of the Twitter button to the user's terminal
	    device. Lotum one therefore has no influence on the extent of the data that
	    Twitter collects with the help of this button and informs the user
	    according to its own level of knowledge: only the IP address of the user's
	    device and the text of the service are transmitted, when the button is
	    used, and are not used for purposes other than displaying the button.
	</p>
	<p>
	    10.2. For the transmission to the USA, there is an EU Commission adequacy
	    decision (No. 2016/1250) according to which companies that meet certain
	    criteria ensure an adequate level of protection, also known as the "EU-US
	    Privacy Shield". These companies are listed in the so-called "Privacy
	    Shield List". Twitter is one of the companies listed therein. The data
	    transmission to Twitter connected to the social plugin is based on Art. 45
	    and 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is the adjustment
	    of the service according to the preferences and wishes of the users.
	</p>
	<p>
	    10.3. The legal basis for using this social plugin is the user's consent
	    according to Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. a) or Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
	    Our legitimate interest is to provide the best possible service based on
	    the wishes and preferences of our users.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>11. </strong>
	    <strong>Communication between users</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    We want to inform the user that content uploaded within the offer can be
	    made publicly accessible and can be seen by other users. We therefore ask
	    the user to handle the information provided by him/her carefully. Uploaded
	    user content is transmitted in order to fulfil the purpose of the service
	    pursuant to Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>12. </strong>
	    <strong>Storage period and erasure of data</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    We process personal data of the user as long as the user is registered for
	    the use of the app and the website, or as long as it is necessary to
	    achieve the purposes of the processing, or is prescribed by a legal
	    obligation to store the data. Subsequently, the data in the generally
	    immediately deleted.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Data that we store for legal reasons, however, is stored for as long as
	    this is required by law (up to ten years).
	</p>
	<p>
	    Data that we store in consideration of legal disputes, however, is stored
	    for as long as this is legally permissible. This can be up to 30 years.
	</p>
	<p>
	    With regard to logs that store network data, we delete the data at regular
	    intervals - the exact time varies depending on configuration rules (which
	    can shorten the logs by size and not by a specified time), whether the data
	    was part of a snapshot that ended up in a backup, and whether the logs are
	    part of a set of logs that are routinely forwarded to a central log
	    repository, but in no case longer than two years.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>13. </strong>
	    <strong>Transmission to Third Parties</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    Personal data will only be passed on to third parties - unless otherwise
	    set out elsewhere in this privacy policy - without the express consent of
	    the user, if this is necessary for the provision of Lotum one services or
	    for contract execution with the user (e.g. for processing payments,
	    including in-app purchases, or for the technical provision of the offer).
	    Accordingly, the data are transmitted to such service providers (such as
	    payment service providers, advertising providers, technical service
	    providers) for the purposes of contract fulfilment pursuant to Art. 6 par.
	    1 s. 1 lit. b) GDPR. Before passing on the user's personal data, Lotum one
	    naturally ensures that the respective service provider has taken
	    appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of
	    the data.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Otherwise, Lotum one will not pass on the user's personal data to third
	    parties unless the user has expressly consented to the transfer (Art. 6
	    par. 1 s. 1 lit. a) GDPR), or Lotum one is entitled or obliged to do so by
	    legal provisions or court orders. In the latter case, the transmission is
	    carried out by Lotum one to fulfil a legal obligation pursuant to Art. 6
	    par. 1 s. 1 lit. c) DSGVO.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>14. </strong>
	    <strong>Data security</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    Lotum one hereby clarifies that data protection and data security cannot be
	    guaranteed for transmissions outside Lotum one's sphere of influence, e.g.
	    within your mobile network. We therefore draw the user's attention to the
	    fact that his mobile network operator or unauthorized third parties may
	    have access to the data that the user is transmitted to our servers or that
	    is transmitted by us.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>15. </strong>
	    <strong>User rights</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    15.1 Right to information
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user has the right to obtain free of charge in writing from Lotum one
	    the personal data stored by Lotum one concerning him, the processing
	    purposes, their origin, which transfer to which recipients or categories of
	    recipients took place, the storage period and the rights of the data
	    subjects available to him or her.
	</p>
	<p>
	    15.2 Right to correction, deletion and/or limitation of data processing
	</p>
	<p>
	    Furthermore, the user has the right to request at any time the correction
	    of incorrect data, the deletion and/or restriction of the processing of
	    personal data stored about him, unless Lotum one is legally obliged to
	    retain such data. Insofar as this includes such personal data that is
	    necessary for the provision of services to the user, the deletion or
	    restriction of the processing of this data can only take place when the
	    user no longer uses Lotum one's services.
	</p>
	<p>
	    15.3 Right of objection
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user has the right to object at any time to data processing based on
	    Art. 6 par. 1 s. 1 lit. e) or f) GDPR for reasons arising from his
	    particular situation, unless Lotum one can prove compelling reasons worthy
	    of protection, which outweigh the interests of the user, or the processing
	    serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. The user can object to
	    data processing for the purpose of direct advertising at any time without
	    special reasons being required.
	</p>
	<p>
	    15.4 Right to Data Portability
	</p>
	<p>
	    If the user provides data relating to him or her and Lotum one processes
	    such data on the basis of the user's consent or in order to fulfil the
	    contract, the user may request that the user receive such data in a
	    structured, current and machine-readable format from Lotum one or that
	    Lotum one transmit such data to another person responsible, insofar as this
	    is technically possible (so-called right to data portability).
	</p>
	<p>
	    15.5 Right to revoke consent
	</p>
	<p>
	    Any consent given by the user to the use of personal data can be freely
	    revoked by the user at any time with effect for the future.
	</p>
	<p>
	    15.6 Right to complain to a supervisory authority
	</p>
	<p>
	    The user may also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority against
	    data processing which he considers to be in breach of the statutory
	    provisions.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>16. </strong>
	    <strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	    Lotum one reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time,
	    while Lotum one will always comply with the legal requirements for data
	    protection. Therefore, Lotum one recommends that users regularly take note
	    of the applicable privacy policy. Lotum one will inform users in advance of
	    any further use of data.
