			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<br/>
			Last updated: May 25. 2018
			<br/><br/>
			
			This Privacy Policy applies to all of Kristanix's games, websites and other related services (collectively the "Services"). By using our Services, you acknowledge and consent to the terms of this privacy policy.
<br/><br/>
			This policy will let you know:
<br/><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>What information (often referred to as "data") is collected.</li>
				<li>How your information is used.</li>
				<li>With whom your information may be shared.</li>
				<li>How you can access, update, or delete your information.</li>
			</ul>
<br/>
			We will comply with all relevant and applicable legislative requirements, and, in the event of any inconsistency, the legislative requirements will override the provisions of this document.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Data collected automatically</b>
<br/><br/>
			Certain data is collected automatically. This includes:
<br/><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Anonymous data about your game progress.</li>
				<li>Anonymous data about your device, such as device name, operating system, browser type and language.</li>
<!--				<li>Anonymous data about your use of our Services, such as gameplay data and your interactions with other players inside the Services.</li>	-->
				<li>Mobile device identifier (advertising ID). There are ways to prevent this, which are outlined in the advertising/third-party lists below.</li>
			</ul>
<br/>			
			We do not use cookies on our website.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Data you provide us</b>
<br/><br/>
			We collect and store your email when you sign up for our newsletter or if you sign up for a Kristanix account.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Data we collect from our third-party partners</b>
<br/><br/>
			To operate and manage our Services we need to use third-party service providers from time to time. A list of those parties can be found in this privacy policy. The type of information we might collect from them includes:
<br/><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Anonymous data for analytics purposes, so we can keep improving our games.</li>
				<li>Demographic data (such as which country you are from).</li>
<!--			<li>Data we receive if you link a third-party tool with the Services (such as login using your Facebook or Google account).</li>	-->
			</ul>
<br/>			
			<b>How do we use the data we collect?</b>
<br/><br/>
			Data collected will always be treated securely and in accordance with this document, and any applicable legislation. We may analyze, profile and segment all collected data in anonymized form, to improve our games.
<br/><br/>
			If any app crashes occur, we collect anonymous, non-personal device information provided automatically by your device to help understand what caused the crash. 
<br/><br/>
			<b>Newsletter</b>
<br/><br/>
			When you opt-in to join our mailing list for the purpose of receiving our newsletter, we will use that to inform you about upcoming games and other promotions related to our games.
<br/><br/>
			You may unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time. All you need to do is unsubscribe from the link in the email.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Advertising</b>
<br/><br/>
			If you have purchased any ad-free versions of our games (or any puzzle/board packs), no ads are shown to you and therefore no data is collected by advertisers.
<br/><br/>
			Advertisements from third-party ad networks may be displayed in the free versions of our games. We take great care in selecting advertising partners. We do not work with companies delivering ads of inappropriate content. As we do not have direct control of which ads are shown in our apps at any given moment, we encourage you to contact us if you find ads in our apps that violate this policy, and report those ads by clicking on the "?", "i" or "ad" icon that's usually in the corner of the ad.
<br/><br/>
			Through our games, you can decline consent so that the advertisers will not be able to collect data in order to show you targeted advertisements.
<br/><br/>
			The list of our ad networks privacy policies may be found here:

			<b>Opting out of targeted advertising</b>
<br/><br/>
			You can also opt-out of targeted-based advertising in all apps, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android). This will prevent mobile device identifier from being collected from all apps on your device.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Analytics</b>
<br/><br/>
			Our Services may also contain APIs from other third-parties used for non-identifiable, anonymous statistical and analytical purposes. Here is a list of their privacy policies:

<br/>			
			<b>Access to your data, and permanent deletion of your data</b>
<br/><br/>
			You have the right to view your data, update your data, have your data deleted, object and restrict to how we use your data. If certain data is processed based on consent given by you, such consent can also be withdrawn by you at any time, for example in the game's settings.
<br/><br/>
			If you wish to know what data we hold about you, if any, or have it deleted, please make out your request to us in writing at the address listed below. Please be aware that in order to protect the information in our database, we will require identification from you before releasing any information. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b>
<br/><br/>
			We will not sell, trade, rent or disclose any of the personal information you provide to us for any reason. Otherwise, your personal information will only be disclosed where required by law.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Age Limits</b>
<br/><br/>
			Our games and our website are not aimed at children under 13 years of age. We do not collect information, nor do we direct interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 years.
<br/><br/>
			If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a person under the age of 13, please contact us at the email address below and the information will be permanently deleted.
<br/><br/>
			<b>Policy Updates</b>
<br/><br/>
			This Policy may change from time to time. The most current version of our Privacy Policy can be found at https://www.kristanix.com/privacy/. We will always keep this up to date so that you know what information we will collect from you, how we may use it, and when we may disclose it.
