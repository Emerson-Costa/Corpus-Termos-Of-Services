<p class="p4">AD IDENTIFIERS, COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</p>
<p class="p9">When you access or use the Service, we may use industry-wide technologies which temporarily store certain information on your smartphone, your computer or other mobile device (“<b>Local Storage</b>”) and that allow us to enable automatic activation of certain features, and make your Service experience much more convenient and effortless. The Local Storage used by the Service is created per session and is removed as your session ends.</p>
<p class="p10">We also use certain monitoring and tracking technologies, including ones offered by third party service providers in order to collect and process Personal Data we specified above. These technologies are used in order to maintain, provide and improve our Services on an ongoing basis, in order to provide a better experience to our users and to provide our customers and potential customers with more relevant advertisements through our Services. For example, these technologies enable us to: (i) keep track of and apply our customer&#8217;s and potential customers’ Services and Website preferences and authenticated sessions, (ii) better secure our Services by detecting abnormal behaviors, (iii) identify technical issues and improve the overall performance of our Services, (iv) monitor and analyze our ads’ performance (v) create and monitor analytics relating to use of our Services, and (v) deliver to you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4">Cookies: A cookie is a small data file that is downloaded and stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit our Website. Learn more about cookies here: www.allaboutcookies.org</li>
<li class="li4">Pixel Tags: Pixel tags (also commonly known as web beacons) are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript placed on our Website or our advertisements and emails, that our third party service providers use to understand how the Website, such advertisements and emails are interacted with.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p10">To learn more about our use of Cookies and other tracking technology that we use please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
<p class="p10">Some of these tracking technologies are provided to us for implementation by our third party services providers referenced in Section ‎4 above. Some of these third party services providers may have direct contractual relationship with you (such as Google and Facebook). Additionally the services provided to us by such third party services providers may entail collection and processing of personal information by such third party services providers, in a scope which is broader than the scope of personal information we are eventually provided with by such third party services providers. This means that sometimes these third party services providers have more access to your personal information than we do. For example, our payment gateway service provider has access to your financial information under strict terms, while we do not receive such access at all in order to better protect your rights. To the extent you have direct contractual relationship with any of our third party services providers, any rights you may have with respect to your information, collected by such third party services providers, shall be governed by such contractual relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Otherwise the terms of this Privacy Policy shall fully apply. <span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span></p>
<p class="p9">In this context you should note that we may use Google and Facebook’s functionality of re-marketing through their tracking cookies and pixel-based retargeting services. This means that if you provided your consent to Google, Facebook or LinkedIn (the “Social Ad Platforms”) to be provided with personalized commercial offers, you may be served with ads (including advertisements of third parties) based on your access to the Services or Website, outside of the Services and Website and across the internet. In such event the Social Ad Platforms, will either place cookies on your web browser or retain similar data in their systems and use such cookies and data to serve you ads based on past visits to our Services and Website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
