</div> <!-- /one_line_col -->

<div class="one_line_col">

<p>When you play our Games we will get, and store some personal data about you that we will use for different purposes as explained in this Policy. 
Most of that data is necessary for us to provide Games to you and for you to play our Games.
</p>

<p>However, in some cases we may ask you to provide us with other personal data or use personal data for purposes that are not necessary to play our Games. 
In those cases, you do not have to provide that personal data to us or have the right to opt out from such use (if the same type of data is used also for other purposes).</p>

<p>Some of our Games will also show advertisements, and on many devices, the ads you see use a specific advertising identifier on your device to provide these advertisements.
If you opted-in to receive personalized advertising in our games, the ads you see are personalized with the help of this advertising identifier. At any time you can opt out again of
personalized advertising in the privacy settings of our games, or you can opt out for all your apps, by turning off the advertising identifier on your device. 
Regardless if you choose to see personalized (more relevant) or non-personalized advertising, you will still receive advertisements.</p>

    and for how long you used that App. This information is used for analytics of how the App works and to be enable us to improve the App.</li>
    
    <li><b>Social network information</b>. If you sign into one of our Apps through a social network and your privacy features on your social network allow it, 
    we are able to access certain information about you through that social network. We only use the types of data that are necessary for our Apps to provide the

  <h2 id="place_of_processing">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>

  <h3>Methods of processing</h3>

  <p>APNAX takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br />
  The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. 
  In addition to APNAX, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of the Apps (administration, sales, marketing, 
  legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, 
  if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>

  <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>

  <p>We may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
    <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
    <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
    <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>

  <h3>Place</h3>

  <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.<br /><br />
Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
  <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br /><br />
If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

  <h3>Retention time</h3>

  <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
  <p>Therefore:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
    <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of  this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br /><br />
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>
