            <h1>Privacy Policy: <em>JFK Moonshot: An Augmented Reality Experience</em></h1>
            <p><em>Effective: May 29, 2019</em></p>
            <p>The John F. Kennedy Library Foundation (“JFKLF,” “we,” or “us”) respects the privacy of our
                users. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information about you obtained
                through our JFKLF Moonshot mobile application (“App”). It also describes your rights and choices with
                respect to the information we collect. By downloading and using our App, you are agreeing to the
                terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>


            <p><strong>SUPPORT</strong><br>
            If you have additional questions, please email us at <a href="mailto:apps@jfklfoundation.org">apps@jfklfoundation.org</a></p>

            <p><strong>Information that We Collect</strong></p>
            <p>You can download and use the App without providing us with any information that identifies you
                directly. We do not require you to create an account or otherwise register with us in order to use
                the App. However, when you launch the App, you have the option to indicate that you are at the John F.
                Kennedy Library. </p>
            <p>Additionally, when you download and use the App, we and our service providers may automatically
                receive and records certain information about your device and your use of the App. For example, this may
                include your device’s IP address, user-agent, features you use within the App, the date and time of your
                activities on the App, time since your last visit, your clicks, searches conducted, your software and
                hardware attributes (including browser and operating system type and version, device screen size, mobile
                app version, device type, and device identifiers), and your general location inferred from IP address.
                To obtain such information, we or our third-party service providers may use the following technologies
                to recognize your device and collect information about your device and App usage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Logs</em></strong><em>. </em>When you use the App, we automatically receive and
                    record certain information from your device and the App. To obtain such information, we may use logs
                    or applications that recognize your device and gather information about its activity.
                </li>
                <li><strong><em>Web beacons, tags, pixels, and similar technologies</em></strong><em>. </em>The
                    App or the notifications that you receive from us may use an application known as a “web beacon”
                    (also known as a “tag” or “pixel”) and similar technologies. A web beacon is a string of HTML or
                    JavaScript code embedded in a website or email that provides a method for transferring data to a
                    company’s servers. For example, it may load a single-pixel image that permits us or our
                    service providers to generate a record of your visit. This allows us to understand the features you
                    use or the pages you visit and whether you have opened a particular notification.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Mobile advertising IDs and SDKs</em></strong>. We or our service providers may use
                    mobile advertising identifiers (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) to collect
                    information for analytics and interest-based advertising purposes, as described in the section below
                    titled “Third-Party Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.” We also may include third-party
                    software development kits (“SDK”) in our App. An SDK consists of third-party code that we may use to
                    add features to our App and allow our service providers to collect information through the
                    App. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
            <p>JFKLF and our service providers use the information that we collect for a variety of purposes,
                including: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Providing the App. </strong>To provide and improve our App and for other purposes
                    related to managing our organization;</li>
                <li><strong>Communicating with you. </strong>To communicate with you about important updates
                    regarding our App, and other administrative issues, including via push notices and in-App
                    notifications;</li>
                <li><strong>Conducting analytics. </strong>To count and recognize users of the App, analyze how
                    the App is used, and conduct analytics, including as described in the section below titled
                    “Third-Party Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising”; </li>
                <li><strong>Compiling aggregated and de-identified information. </strong>To compile aggregated
                    and de-identified statistics or reports that we may share with partners or other third
                    parties;</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How We Share Information </strong></p>
            <p>We share your information with other parties for a variety of purposes, as described
                below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Service Providers. </em></strong>JFKLF may use third-party service providers to
                    perform services on our behalf, including data-hosting companies and analytics providers. We may
                    permit these third-party service providers to collect and use information on our behalf or we may
                    share information with these service providers for the purposes described in this
                    Policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Aggregated and de-identified information</em></strong>. From time to time, JFKLF may
                    also share aggregated and de-identified information about users, such as by publishing reports on
                    trends in the usage of the Services. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Third-Party Analytics and Interest-based Advertising</strong></p>
            <p>We partner with third parties to engage in analytics, auditing, research, and reporting on our App.
                These third parties collect information regarding your usage of the App as described in the section
                above titled “Information that We Collect,” and they may use logs, web beacons, tags, pixels, mobile
                advertising IDs (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Android Advertising ID), and similar technologies. In particular, we use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/" class="external" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a> and <a href="https://www.kochava.com/" class="external" target="_blank">Kochava</a> to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above.  You may opt out of Google Analytics for Firebase and Kochava by following the mobile application opt-out instructions below.</p>

            <p>We also partner with third parties to provide advertising services that are targeted based on your
                online activities across websites, mobile apps, and devices over time (commonly referred to as
                “interest-based advertising”). Our advertising partners may collect information about your activities on
                our App on your current device and combine it with information about your activities on other websites
                and mobile apps or devices. They may collect such information using logs, web beacons, tags, pixels,
                mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID), and similar technologies. For
                example, our advertising partners may use the fact that you visited our App to target advertising to you
                on non-JFKLF mobile apps on your current device or on other devices you use. You can opt out of
                interest-based advertising in web browsers and mobile apps on your current browser or device by
                following the instructions below. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Web browser opt-out</em></strong>. To opt out in web browsers, please visit <a
                        href="https://optout.aboutads.info" class="external" target="_blank">optout.aboutads.info</a>
                    and <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org" class="external"
                        target="_blank">optout.networkadvertising.org</a>. To help preserve your
                    choices, you can install the “Protect My Choices” extension that is available at <a

                        target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/PMC</a>.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Mobile application opt-out</em></strong>. To opt out in mobile apps, you can adjust
                    the advertising preferences on your mobile device. In iOS, visit Settings &gt; Privacy &gt;
                    Advertising &gt; Limit Ad Tracking. In Android, visit Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt
                    out of interest-based ads or Opt out of Personalized Advertising.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also opt out for participating companies by downloading the Digital Advertising Alliance’s
                AppChoices tool at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" class="external"
                    target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> and following the instructions in the app.
                For more information about opting out on mobile devices, please see <a
                    href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice" class="external"
                    target="_blank">https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice</a>.</p>
            <p>Please note that the opt-outs described above will apply only to the specific browser or device from
                which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and
                devices. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile advertising identifiers, change browsers
                (including upgrading certain browsers), or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no
                longer work and you will need to opt out again. </p>
            <p><strong>Third-Party Links, Websites, and Apps</strong></p>
            <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or other mobile applications. If you follow a link
                to any of these websites or applications, please note that those websites and applications, and any
                services that may be accessible through them, have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible
                for the privacy practices of other websites and applications. We encourage our users to be aware when
                they leave the App and to read the privacy policies applicable to such third-party websites and Apps.
                This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected in connection with the App.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong></p>
            <p>JFKLF provides you with choices to review, access, and update your information or to exercise your
                data protection rights, as follows: </p>
            <p>You can adjust your push notification preferences in your device’s settings. </p>
            <p>You may have additional rights under applicable laws to request access to, correction of, deletion
                of, or restrictions on the processing of certain information. You also may have rights under applicable
                laws to opt out of or withdraw consent to further processing, request copies of your data, or lodge a
                complaint with a data protection authority in your jurisdiction. To make such request and/or inquire
                about such rights, please send us an email at <a
                    href="mailto:jfkmoonshot@jfklfoundation.org">jfkmoonshot@jfklfoundation.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Data Security and Retention </strong></p>
            <p>JFKLF uses reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect your information
                against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no security program is
                100% secure, and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the App.</p>
            <p>We retain the information collected through the App for as long as reasonably necessary to deliver
                our App to you, to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, or as required by law.
            </p>
            <p><strong>International Users</strong></p>
            <p>The information that we collect through or in connection with the App is transferred to and processed
                in the United States for the purposes described above. JFKLF also may subcontract the processing of your
                data to, or otherwise share your data with third parties in the United States or countries other than
                your country of residence. The data-protection laws in these countries may be different from, and less
                stringent than, those in your country of residence. By installing the App or by providing any
                information to us, you expressly consent to such transfer and processing.</p>
            <p>Our legal basis for processing information will depend on the type of information at issue and the
                purpose for which it is collected and used. We process information as necessary to provide the App
                to you. We may also rely on our legitimate interests to process the information for the purposes
                described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
            <p>The App is directed at individuals over the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p>
            <p><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
            <p>JFKLF may make changes to the App in the future and as a consequence will need to revise this Policy
                to reflect those changes. You should review this Policy periodically. If we make a material change to
                the Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice. </p>
            <p><strong>How to Contact Us</strong></p>
