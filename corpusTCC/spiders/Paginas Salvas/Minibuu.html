<p><b>Last Revised: 25 May 2020</b></p>

<p>
Minibuu ("Minibuu", "we") are committed to protecting your Personal Data. We offer services and games that can collect information from you and your children, so we have prepared a document called the Privacy Policy. In this Privacy Policy, we will explain what we do with the Personal Data that you provide to us or which we can collect from you in the provision of services to you.
</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy is in compliance with the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>1. WHO WE ARE?</b>
<br>
Minibuu is a company with registered office in Tijuana, Mexico.

We are the Personal Data controllers responsible for your Personal Data. A Personal Data controller is the person who decides for what purposes Personal Data will be used.

Our contact details are as follows:

Minibuu
Tijuana, Mexico.
Phone: +526644471708
Email: info@minibuu.com
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your rights, contact us by email at info@minibuu.com.
</p>
<br>


<p>
<b>2. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</b><br>
While you visit our website at www.minibuu.com or you play Minibuu games ("Services" or "Games"), we may collect information about you ("Personal Data").

We care about your Personal Data protection, so we have developed this Privacy Policy.

By this Privacy Policy, we want to clearly and comprehensibly explain what data we collect, how we use, disclose and transfer it.

From time to time, we may change the terms of this Privacy Policy, so do not forget to read this Privacy Policy on a regular basis to understand how we use your Personal Data.

If we make a material change to this policy, we will post a notice on our website prior to making the change. If we have your parent email address, we will contact you to let you know about the changes.
</p>
<br>


<p>
<b>3. WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT?</b><br>

I do not collect any information through or about the usage of my games whatsoever. I used to collect anonymous usage statistics to help me improve my game, but in the light of the European GPDR, I decided I did not wanted to annoy my players with a consent popup, so I removed all forms of analytics from all of my games. I also disable and disallow any plugins I use to create my games to collect any anonymous data. <br><br>

Unity, one of the game engines I use, implements an interface on Android to request a device's Android Device ID and the Advertising ID. I don't use these interfaces in my games whatsoever, and have confirmed with Unity that the data that could be requested from these interfaces isn't used by Unity internally either and never leaves your device.
