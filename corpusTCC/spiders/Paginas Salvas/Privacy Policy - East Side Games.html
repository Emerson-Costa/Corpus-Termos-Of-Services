<p>We use third parties, who we share your information with.

<p>Information collected by third parties is governed by the applicable third party privacy policy, which may provide for broader information collection than collected by ESG. These third parties may use your information internally and disclose your information to others and we strongly recommend that you read each <a href="https://www.eastsidegames.com/list-of-sdk-3rd-party-providers-and-plug-ins/" target="_blank">third party</a> privacy policy carefully before providing your information.</p>

<h3>7.  ADVERTISING</h3>
<p>The Services may contain advertisements served by third parties.  These advertisements use Tracking Technologies to collect information about you, for example, demographics, location and device information, in order to serve you appropriate advertisements and to recognize your device each time a third party serves you an advertisement.  Based on this information, third parties may be able to resolve your identity across multiple devices, for example, matching your IP address across multiple devices, in order to target advertisements to you based on your online behavior.  This information is collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the applicable third party privacy policy, as described in section 4 above.</p>
<p>You may be able to opt-out of mobile behavioral advertising by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android device and selecting the appropriate advertisement tracking settings.</p>

<p>Your username and profile picture on the Services are visible to other users of the Services.  We recommend you exercise discretion when selecting your username and profile picture and when using the Services.  Personal information disclosed by you within our chat areas, instant message service, message boards or during use of the Services can be collected by other users and may result in unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties through our Services (for example, sending your telephone number to another user through the chat service).  To the extent that you create a public profile that may be available to others on our Services, you are solely responsible for its content and accuracy.  To edit, change, or delete the above information, follow the instructions provided in the Services.</p>
<h3>9.  COOKIES</h3>
<p>A cookie is a file that is sent by a service through your browser to your computer, if your browser is enabled to accept cookies, in order to store certain information on your computer and communicate with a service while you are online.

<h3>10.  CALIFORNIA DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE</h3>
<p>Do Not Track, or DNT, is a web browser setting that requests that a web application disable its tracking of you.  When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, advertising networks, plug-in providers and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity.  Currently, there is no DNT technology standard and, as a result, the Services do not respond to DNT signals.</p>
<h3>11. CALIFORNIA “SHINE THE LIGHT” RIGHT</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.82 grants you the right to request ESG’s disclosure of the categories of personal information we provided to third parties, and the names and addresses of these third parties, for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

<p>If you are between the age of 13 and 18, please have your parent or guardian read the Privacy Policy and get his or her permission before you provide any personal information and before you sign up for or use the Services.

However, ESG cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.  Your use of the Services is at your own risk.
