<h3>Data Breach</h3>
<p>When a data breach occurs, we will notify you via email within 72 hours.</p>

<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

<h3>Payments</h3>
<p>We provide paid products and services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing.
We do not collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors. These payment processors comply to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>
<p>The processors we work with are:</p>
<ul>

</ul>


<h3>Links To Other Sites</h3>
<p>Service may contain links to sites that are not influenced by us. If you click on a third party link, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of the site you are visiting.</p>


<h3>Children Online Privacy Protection</h3>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 16 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 16 years old. And use of our app is not supported by our user interface.</p>
<h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>

<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.
  <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
  <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy” and can easily be found on the page specified above.
</ul>

<h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes via email or within our Service.</p>

<h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>

<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
  <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
  <li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service
  <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.
</ul>

<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
  <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
  <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
  <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
  <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
  <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of each email.
</ul>
