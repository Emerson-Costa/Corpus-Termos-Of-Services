<li>To a <strong>competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party </strong>where the disclosure is required and necessary (i) as a matter of mandatory applicable law or regulation and/or valid court order, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To a <strong>potential or actual buyer </strong>(and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To any <strong>other person with your consent </strong>to the disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="legalbasis">Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</h3>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<p>We will process your information for the purposes of operating our Website, Games and other Services and communicating with you as necessary for those purposes and in our legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, undertaking marketing activities, improving our Games, Website and other Services, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.</p>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us via email <a href="mailto:privacy@seriously.com">privacy@seriously.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how">How Does Seriously Keep My Personal Information Secure?</h3>
<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we use are, for example, encrypting your personal information in transit and at rest, only collecting vital data, as well as ensuring access to the data is restricted internally and externally.</p>
<h3 id="datatransfers">International Data Transfers</h3>
<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>
<p>Specifically, our servers are located in United States, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.</p>
<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. All third parties that are located outside of EEA are certified under “Privacy Shield” (framework for EU-USA data transfer) or employ European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.</p>
<h3 id="dataretention">Data Retention</h3>
<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<h3 id="dataprotection">Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
<p>You have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion </strong>of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition, in certain cases, you can <strong>object to processing </strong>of your personal information, ask us to <strong>restrict processing </strong>of your personal information, or <strong>request portability </strong>of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to <strong>opt-out of marketing communications </strong>we send you at any time.
