<p>If you are a player located in the European Countries, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information.</p>
<p>If you are located in the European Countries, you have the following rights:</p>

<li>If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong>at any time through the settings within our Applications or by requesting this change through the Contact Us link within our Applications or directly send us an email to our support team at support (at) huuugegames.com. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
<li>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority </strong>about our collection and use of your personal information which is to be in Huuuge’s case –the leading protection authority is Polish President of the Office of Data Protection. You may also contact your local data protection authority. For more information, please contact such authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise your rights to access or deletion, please submit a request through the Contact Us link within our Applications or directly send us an email to our support team at support (at) huuugegames.com. We ask that you submit all requests through the Application itself to ensure that, at a minimum, we have sufficient information about the user to enable us to service the request. While you send us email message we may ask you to provide more information about you like: player ID in our game. If you do not provide us with accurate information or we do not have access to your email address and your player ID and sufficient consent, if required, we will not be responsible for failure to exercise your rights as we will not be able to identify you as our player. We respond to all data protection requests we receive in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p><strong>2   </strong><strong>Accessing and deleting personal data held by Huuuge</strong></p>
<p>You can request a copy of or deletion of your game account data through our game.</p>
<p>To review and update personal data (including given us consents) associated with your Huuuge player profile in certain games, visit “Settings” within that Application.</p>
<p>If you want to review or delete your game account, please submit a request through the Application itself or through our support.</p>
<p>For deletion requests, we will take reasonable measures to delete your personal data from our records. We will keep certain records (e.g., personal data relating to payments or customer service matters) where we need (and have rights) to, such as for legal or accounting purposes. We will also keep data in order to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.</p>
<p><strong>3   </strong><strong>Managing personal data from third-party applications and from your mobile device</strong></p>
<p>To manage the information we receive from third-party applications and from your mobile device, use the settings provided by the third-party application and your mobile device.</p>
<p>You also can manage many aspects of data collection and use from your mobile device by visiting the “settings” of your mobile device or web browser and reviewing the access permissions of each game / application.</p>
<p>Once we receive your data from a third-party application / platform or your mobile device, that data is stored and used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described above.</p>
<p><strong>4   </strong><strong>Opting In or Out of marketing communication with Huuuge</strong></p>
<p>You can unsubscribe from promotional emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link. You can opt out of mobile push notifications in your device’s settings page.</p>
<p>If you want to stop receiving push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on, you can turn of push notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “Settings”. Many of our games also offer the ability to turn off push notifications in the in-game “Settings”.</p>
<p>Please note that if you opt in or out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information about the games you are using from us, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or Huuuge End User License Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>5   </strong><strong>Opting in or out of third-party tailored advertising</strong></p>
<p>While you give us your consent for obtaining the personalized advertising from our third-party partners, you can opt in or opt out of third-party customized advertising through your device Settings and other third-party opt-in or opt-out tools.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on “Limit Ad Tracking”). You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous “Advertising Identifier.” Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising.</p>
<p>All of the opt-in or opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not by us. Huuuge does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.</p>
<p>Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in our games after using these tools, but the advertising you see would not be customized to your interests or needs.</p>

                            <p>When you use our games, your personal data may be sent outside of the European Counties, for example, to the United States, Israel and Hong Kong and possibly other countries. When we transfer, store, and use personal data collected in the European Countries outside of the European Countries, we comply with our legal obligations and ensure that your personal data is subject to suitable safeguards (such as encrypting communication) or transferred to “approved” territories.</p>
<p>As a global company, we may transfer your personal data to our “Affiliated Entities,” located in European Countries and outside like United States, Israel and Hong Kong which are any other corporate entities under common ownership with Huuuge, or to our business partners and service providers from time to time for our legitimate business purposes. For example, Huuuge provides certain services to its Affiliates.</p>
<p>We store personal data about players and visitors to our sites on servers located in the United States, and we may also store this information on servers and equipment in other countries. Personal information collected in the European Countries may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the European Countries.

This staff may be engaged in, among other things, marketing communication with players and product development. When we transfer your personal data internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your data is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.</p>
<p>Additionally, if we share with entities which are not subject to the Privacy Shield framework, and we make sure that these entities ensure an adequate level of protection, the transfer is supported by the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to a country outside the European Countries. These standard contractual clauses are available here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/</a>.</p>

<li>your image and/or voice that you provide us by using your device’s front-facing camera. The use of your image means than we can store, copy, reproduce, distribute and make it available for other users</li>
<li>your device location information</li>
<li>metadata that are uploaded automatically when you upload video. In essence, metadata describes other data and provides information about your content that will not always be evident to the viewer. In connection with your video the metadata can describe how, when and by whom the piece of content was collected and how that content is formatted. It further includes information such as your account name that enables other users to trace back the video to your user account. Metadata will further consist of additional data that you chose to provide with the video, e.g. any hashtags used to mark keywords to the video or comments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Children</u></strong></p>
<p>Huuuge Gameface is not addressed to the children under the age of 16 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 16. Children under 16 should not use Huuuge Gameface at any time. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under 16, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under the age of 16, please contact us at your earliest opportunity using the Contact Us link within Huuuge Gameface.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice (</span><b>this Section</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is part of the Huuuge Privacy Policy and specifically provides information on how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information of our players who are individual residents of the State of California within the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (</span><b>the CCPA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms in this California Notice section of the Huuuge Privacy Policy mean the same as they are defined elsewhere in our Privacy Policy or as defined in the CCPA.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Collecting Personal Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCPA defines “</span><b>Personal Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” as “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and the use of Personal Information in this Section has this meaning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have provided below the categories of Personal Information we have collected about our players in the preceding 12 months, as well as the source of the Personal Information and our business purposes for collecting the Personal Information: </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to any other rights under the law or elsewhere in the Privacy Policy, you have the right to the following: </span></p>
<p><b><i>Right to Know</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California residents have the right to request that we disclose certain information about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The categories of personal information we collected about you.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can only provide you with this information if you send us a </span><b>verified request</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which we explain further below. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Right to Delete</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information that we have collected from you and that we have retained, subject to certain exceptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we receive and confirm your </span><b>verified</b> <b>request</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we will delete (and request to our service providers the same) your Personal Information that we have collected and retained, unless an exception applies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can only delete your Personal Information if you send us a </span><b>verified request</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which we explain further below. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Other Rights</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also have the right to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the right not to be discriminated against if you exercise any of your rights with us under the CCPA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be authorized to act on your behalf, your authorized agent will need to provide us with proof that they have written permission to act on your behalf. The request will also need to be a </span><b>verified request</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Making a Verified Request</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to exercise your rights under the CCPA, we will need to get from you a </span><b>verified request. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to send us a </span><b>verified request</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first way is to send us the request through our games. This is the preferred method because then your PlayerID comes to us automatically. Please reference “CCPA” in your request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second way is to send an email to </span><a href="mailto:dpo@huuugegames.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dpo@huuugegames.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you send us the request, you will need to include your Player ID. Please reference “CCPA” in your request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please make sure that you include sufficient information in your request as to what you want from us. For example, if you want us to delete your data, please tell us that. If you want to request a copy of your data, please tell us that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may need to verify your identity before processing any request; but we will try to limit the additional Personal Information that we collect in order to process your request. We reserve the right to decline a request to exercise rights under CCPA, particularly if we are unable to verify your identity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using an authorized agent, the authorized agent will still need to submit a request as above along with proof of the authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make a request up to twice every twelve months. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
